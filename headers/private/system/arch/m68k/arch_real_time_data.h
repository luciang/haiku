		// Since there're no cheap atomic_{set,get,add}64() on PPC 32 (i.e. one
		// that doesn't involve a syscall), we can't have just a single
		// system_time_offset and set/get it atomically.
		// That's why have our data twice. One set is current (indexed by
		// version % 2). When setting the offset, we do that with disabled
		// interrupts and protected by a spinlock. We write the new values
		// into the other array element and increment the version.
		// A reader first reads the version, then the date of interest, and
		// finally rechecks the version. If it hasn't changed in the meantime,
		// the read value is fine, otherwise it runs the whole procedure again.
		//
		// system_time_conversion_factor is currently consider constant,
		// although that is not necessarily true. We simply don't support
		// changing conversion factors at the moment.
