/* constants for extractors */

extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_DURATION; 
  // Output only: Selects the duration of the stream.
  //
  // This is the playing time of the stream, which may be
  // different from some or all of the durations for the
  // individual streams.  Return a negative number if the
  // duration is not a useful number. (like streaming audio)
  // This duration may be an estimate because determining
  // the exact duration may require parsing an entire file.
  // This duration may also be updated over time.  For
  // example, a file being read may also be being written to
  // by someone else.

extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_COPYRIGHT;
  // Output only: Selects the copyright notice of the stream.
  //
  // This is a string with a copyright notice.  The
  // string belongs to the extractor, so don't delete
  // or change it.

extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_TRACK_COUNT;
  // Output only: Selects the count of the
  // number of tracks in the stream.
  //
  // This is the current number of tracks in the stream.

extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_FRAME_COUNT;
  // Output only: Selects the count of the
  // number of frames in the stream.
  //
  // This is the current number of frames in the stream.
  // See BMediaTrack::CountFrames()
  
extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_CURRENT_FRAME_INDEX;
  // Output only: Selects the index of the
  // current frame in the stream.
  //
  // This is the current frame in the stream.
  // See BMediaTrack::CurrentFrame()

extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_CURRENT_TIME;
  // Output only: Selects the current time of the stream.
  //
  // This is the time at the current position of the stream.
  // See BMediaTrack::CurrentTime()

extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_ENCODED_FORMAT;
  // Output only: Selects the native encoded format of the streams data.
  //
  // See BMediaTrack::EncodedFormat()
  
extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_TRACK_CODEC_INFO;
  // Output only: Selects the codec information for this stream
  //
  // See BMediaTrack::GetCodecInfo()
  
extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_QUALITY;
  // Input/output: Selects the quality rating for this stream
  //
  // See BMediaTrack::GetQuality and BMediaTrack::SetQuality

// Used for extractor-based seek:
extern _IMPEXP_MEDIA const char * const B_MEDIA_SEEK_STREAM_NUMBER;
  // Input/Output: Selects the stream to be selected for seeking.
  //
  // When the extractor is asked to seek, it will seek on
  // this stream, and then seek the other streams depending
  // on where it ends up on the first stream.  A typical
  // value for this corresponds to a video stream.  In this
  // case the video stream will be seeked to the closest key
  // frame for example, and then any other streams will be
  // seeked to that time.  Only 'open' streams will be
  // seeked.
