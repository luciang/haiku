A pickup with three guys in it pulls into the lumber yard.  One of the men gets out and goes into the office.

"I need some four-by-two's," he says.
"You must mean two-by-four's" replies the clerk.
The man scratches his head.  "Wait a minute," he says, "I'll go check." 
	Back, after an animated conversation with the other occupants of the truck, he reassures the clerk, that, yes, in fact, two-by-fours would be acceptable.
"OK," says the clerk, writing it down, "how long you want 'em?"
The guy gets the blank look again.  "Uh... I guess I better go check," he says.
	He goes back out to the truck, and there's another animated conversation.  The guy comes back into the office.  "A long time," he says, "we're building a house".

	[I plan] to see, hear, touch, and destroy everything in my path, including beets, rutabagas, and most random vegetables, but excluding yams, as I am absolutely terrified of yams...
	Actually, I think my fear of yams began in my early youth, when many of my young comrades pelted me with same for singing songs of far-off lands and deep blue seas in a language closely resembling that of the common sow. My psychosis was further impressed into my soul as I reached adolescence, when, while skipping through a field of yams, light-heartedly tossing flowers into the stratosphere, a great yam-picking machine tore through the fields, pursuing me to the edge of the great plantation, where I escaped by diving into a great ditch filled with a mixture of water and pig manure, which may explain my tendency to scream, "Here come the Martians!  Hide the eggs!" every time I have pork.  But I digress.  The fact remains that I cannot rationally
deal with yams, and pigs are terrible conversationalists.
