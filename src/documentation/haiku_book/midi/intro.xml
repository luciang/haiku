		The <emphasis>Midi Kit</emphasis> provides classes capable of understanding the MIDI file format and synthesising the sounds described within. Furthermore, it also provides mechanisms for communicating with MIDI compliant hardware via messages.

		<note>There are two versions of the Midi Kit, the latter reportedly much more up-to-date and more compatible with other applications. Though sadly it is undocumented. For more information consult the headers (At least until such time as this document is further updated).
