<UL>

<LI><P>Simple integer expressions + - * / | & ~ ()</P></LI>

<LI><P>Make user-defined types more powerful. Some ideas: bitmask fields (for 
app_flags), choice fields (for app_version), specify boolean fields as "name" 
(true) or "!name" (false), conditional constructs, fixed-size strings and 
arrays.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Importing files. Right now, you must specify the resource data in the 
rdef script, which is messy for (large) binary files. The "import" feature lets 
you copy the contents of such files (pictures, icons, etc.) straight into your 
resources.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Attributes, so you can also use rdef scripts to add attributes to your 
files instead of (or in addition to) resources.</P></LI> 

<LI><P>In "auto names" mode, the decompiler currently does not use the enum 
symbol table. So if two resources have the same name and that name is a valid 
C/C++ identifier, the decompiler will add two conflicting symbols to the enum 
statement. This can also happen when multiple input files have conflicting 
resource IDs.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Support for the built-in types point, rect, and rgb_color is hardcoded 
into the decompiler. The other types, app_flags etc, are not supported at all. 
It would be better to use the type symbol table for this as well. Then the 
decompiler can also support user-defined types (although these type definitions 
must be provided to the decompiler somehow.)</P></LI>

<LI><P>Right now, archives are treated as messages. Maybe we should give them 
their own type, B_ARCHIVED_OBJECT (type code 'ARCV').</P></LI>
