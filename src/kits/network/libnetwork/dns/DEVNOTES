BIND 9.3.1
ported to Haiku

This file contains important information for developers who want to update this BIND port.
I created config.h, port_before.h, and port_after.h with "configure --enable-threads --disable-ipv6" on a BONE-compatible system and fixed some mistakes that the script made. All changes to these three files are marked with a comment containing the keyword CHANGED.

TODO:
	add support for IPv6
	improve pthread support to fix TLS/mutex hack

Added folders and files:
	headers (some headers are not defined in Haiku)
	src (functions that are not part of Haiku, e.g.: strsep)
	
	All BIND headers were moved to legacy/network (public) and private/net (private) in the system-wide headers folder.

Removed files:
	irs/
		dns_gr.c
		dns_pw.c
		gen_gr.c
		gen_pw.c
		getgrent.c
		getgrent_r.c
		getpwent.c
		getpwent_r.c
		irp_gr.c
		irp_pw.c
		lcl_gr.c
		lcl_pw.c
		nis_gr.c
		nis_ho.c
		nis_ng.c
		nis_nw.c
		nis_pr.c
		nis_pw.c
		nis_sv.c


Porting issues:
	BIND wants to include sys/un.h and utmp.h. We do not have these, so I put empty headers into the private headers folder.
	
	Added a hacky workaround when building for non-Haiku targets: select.h (in legacy headers) only declares pselect() for Haiku.

Added sources for compatibility:
	src/res_resultcodes.c: BONE's host command wants _res_resultcodes to be defined

Changes made to the sources and headers:
	nameser_compat.h: added check for __HAIKU__ and __BEOS__ to not redefine endianness
	
	arpa/inet.h, netdb.h, resolv.h, nameser.h, nameser_compat.h: removed check for _REENTRANT (we are always reentrant), removed all checks for other operating systems
	
	irs/gai_strerror.c, irs/irs_data.c: Switched to BeOS-native TLS in gai_strerror() and net_data_init() using a very ugly hack (see src/TLSInit.cpp). We need full mutex support!
