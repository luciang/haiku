BIND 9.3.1
ported to Haiku

This file contains important information for developers who want to update this BIND port.
I created config.h, port_before.h, and port_after.h with "configure --enable-threads --disable-ipv6" on a BONE-compatible system and fixed some mistakes that the script made. All changes to these three files are marked with a comment containing the keyword CHANGED.

Our private folder are:
	headers (some headers are not defined in Haiku)
	src (functions that are not part of Haiku, e.g.: strsep)

Porting issues:
	BIND wants to include sys/un.h and utmp.h. We do not have these, so I put empty headers into the private headers folder.
	
	Added a hacky workaround when building for non-Haiku targets: select.h (in legacy headers) only declares pselect() for Haiku.

Added sources for compatibility:
	src/res_resultcodes.c: BONE's host command wants _res_resultcodes to be defined

Changes made to the sources and headers:
	nameser_compat.h: added check for __HAIKU__ and __BEOS__ to not redefine endianness
	
	irs/gai_strerror and irs/irs_data.c: Changed the initialization of the mutex lock and rewrote two functions to use BeOS-native TLS.
