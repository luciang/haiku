See libnetwork/dns/DEVNOTES for general notes. This file contains information about the legacy libbind.so.

This folder and the headers folder contained within override the respective libnetwork/dns folder. Additionally, the legacy headers override the default posix headers.
	
The src folder is imported for sources. Currently, it is empty.

You may import files from Haiku's libroot.so if funtionality is missing.

libbind.so links against libnet.so because it needs gethostname() on non-Haiku targets.
