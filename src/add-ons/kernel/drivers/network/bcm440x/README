Broadcom 440x 10/100 Ethernet Driver

To install, double-click the file appropriately named "Double Click to Install". This has not been tested with net_server, but it should work.

The driver is based on version 3.0.8 of the Linux drivers provided by Broadcom corporation, which can be obtained from their website, and is licensed under the GNU General Public License, which can be obtained from the Free Software Foundation.

Questions and support requests should be directed to me at nathanw@uchicago.edu

Many thanks to Broadcom for not being nVidia, and not only publishing source to their driver, but making it quite portable, even if the source was almost uncommented. Thanks as well to Stephen Flood, for allowing me to abuse his laptop in porting this driver.
