There are a lot of USB modems in this world. Not every one can be supported by this driver.
Only CDC ACM-compatible modems will works with it. How you can guess it? Just try to install
this driver and plug your modem in. If you get the usb0 in ports list - it probably works.
If not - <a href="#usbcommander">obtain the information about your device</a> and
<a href="mailto:imker@gmx.li">send it to me</a>.

If your computer has the OHCI-compatible USB hardware you are out of luck. This hardware is not
supported by non-Dan0-like versions. See the <a href="#patches">BeOS.USB.patches</a> vor details and
solutions.

For Dan0 you have to build a special version of binaries.

<h2>1. Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Run install.sh
<li>If all is OK run SerialConnect application and press Alt-D. If you can select the port, that
   looks like "usb0" - your device was identified as supported. You can use this "usb" - port as
   you do with usual "serial" ones. Good luck!
<li>If something goes wrong - open the Terminal and run the following command: 
<p><strong>ls /dev/ports/</strong>
<p>It lists all ports that present on your system. If you have no "usb0" here but sure, that you
   have USB to Serial adapter plugged in your USB port - write an e-mail about your problem. I'll
   try to help you.
</ul>
<h2>2. Uninstallation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Run uninstall.sh
</ul>

<h2>3. Problems solving</h2>  
<ul>
<li>   If this driver crash your system - reboot and press "Space" during load. In boot menu select
   "Disable user add-ons" and continue boot. Uninstall driver and reboot again into normal mode.
   Write me a e-mail about this problem.
</ul>
<h2>4. "Unknown" devices</h2>
<a name="usbcommander"></a>
   If you have something, that looks like USB->RS232(serial) adapter or USB modem and tried it with
   this driver but have no success - download <a href="http://www.zharik.host.sk/prahramy/usb_dev_info.zip">
   usb device info tool</a> and use it to get required information.
<ul>    
<li>Unplug all USB devices and hubs from your PC.    
<li>Go into Terminal and run the following command:
<strong>    ls -alR /dev/bus/usb</strong> 
    You should see something like this:
<pre>
$ ls -alR /dev/bus/usb/

<li> Note this information.    
<li> Now plug your USB serial adapter into PC and run <strong>ls -alR /dev/bus/usb/</strong> again.
You'll get something slightly different:

$                                             
<li> Compare this results with previous one and look for file,
that appeared. This file is your USB serial adapter.   
<li> Unpack downloaded usb_dev_info command and run it with full path to file appeared in
the second listing. For my sample I should run:
usb_dev_info /dev/bus/usb/0/1
I'll get the following:

<h2>What is wrong with BeOS.USB.patches?</h2>
<a name="patches"></a>
All know that "classical" BeOS R5 don't works on OHCI USB hardware. But some time ago on one well-known
BeOS file-sharing network appeared patches for plain R5. Those patches allows to work with OHCI
hardware under this system version. Looks like it is some part of Dan0 or other "leaked" versions.
There are 3 patches in BeOS.USB.patches.zip:
<p>1. beos-usb-patch,
<p>2. beos-usb.modem-patch,
<p>3. beos-usb.modem-patch.sm.    
<p> The Evil is in two last patches. The source of problem - changed functions in tty module. The
Dan0 contains two additional functions in the middle of tty module description table. But the module version
was not changed - it is still v1. So if driver, that was compiled with old tty module layout, will try to use it - system
crashes. Looks like those patches contains the same "enchanced" tty module like in Dan0. So - you should roll back
those modem-patches - restore the previous configuration as described in patches readme. The first one
- "beos-usb-patch" is OK. 

<h2>Information for Dan0 users</h2>  
<a name="Dan0"></a>
The driver is still not working under Dan0 out of box. At first you have no need to use it for ACM-compatible devices,
because Dan0 has it's own implementation of usb_acm driver. There is also one problem with Dan0 - the
"tty" module was chaged in very dangerous way - there is no possibility to create backward compatible
implementation of serial port driver with the new tty interfaces. If you really have one of those USB Serial 
Adapters and want to use it under Dan0 - you have to make some hand work. Sorry for this, but I have not
using Dan0 as my main working system. So you must to build Dan0 version by yourself. Thank you for your patience. Below
is an operations you need to install USB serial driver for Dan0:
<ul>
<li>Obtain the zip archive with the USB Serial driver for R5.
<li>Obtain the zip archive with sources of the driver.
<li>ATTENTION!!! Unplug all USB devices from your PC. You must to do this - in opposite case you
system can crash!  
<li>Install the USB Serial driver as was described in this document.
<li>Unpack the sources of the driver, go to Terminal, change dir to unpacked sources and run the
"make" command. You should see many warnings but no errors.
<li>Stay in Terminal and change the current directory to "obj.x86". You should see the "usb_serial"
driver binary if everything went OK.
<li>Now copy the usb_serial to right place:
<pre>
<b>cp ./usb_serial ~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/usb_serial</b>
</pre>
and let the system to know about changes:
<pre>
<b>rescan usb_serial</b>
</pre>
<li>The last thing you have to do - disable ACM support in this driver:
Open the file /boot/home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/usb_serial in your text editor and add or
uncomment the following string:
<pre>
<b>support_acm_devices false</b>
</pre>
<li>Now you should have working version of USB Serial driver under Dan0.
