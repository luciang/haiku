Professional testing:
If you found a problem with this driver and want to help me in development of this software make the following things (Assume that driver is already installed):

1) Open the file /boot/home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/sis7018 and set following parameters:

debug_output true
debug_output_in_file true

if you have a problems with mixer - it's not work, or settings is not saved on reboot - activate this one too:

debug_trace_ac97 true

2) Reboot your system and try to play something. 

3) After that get the file /boot/home/sis7018.log and send it to me.
 
4) It'll be good on your first bug report to me send also hardware configuration of your system. To get it go into Terminal and run following commands

listdev 

Get all that it say to you and send me too, please ...
