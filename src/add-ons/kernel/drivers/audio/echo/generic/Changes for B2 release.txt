Echo Generic Driver

Release B2

-New firmware for Gina3G & Layla3G that fixes pops and clicks with simultaneous MIDI
and audio I/O.  There is now only one DSP firmware image for both Gina3G and Layla3G.

-The new firmware does not support 8 kHz sampling

-Changed C3g and C3gDco to support the new firmware
	-Added C3gDco::GetAudioMeters virtual method so that the correct meter values
	are returned for Gina3G and Layla3G

-Simplified CChannelMask; the mask is no longer stored byte-swapped on Macs and the 
masks are at most 32 bits wide

-Moved the MakeDaffyDuck method from CEchoGals to a static member of CDaffyDuck; 
the constructor for CDaffyDuck is now protected, so that you can only create new
ducks by calling MakeDaffyDuck.

-Various minor changes to avoid compiler warnings for AMD64 build

-OsSupportWdm has been rewritten to use the WDM DMA APIs

-The code is now licensed under the terms of the Lesser GNU Public License.
