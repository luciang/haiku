Disclaimer
=======

Use at your own risk!

If the Driver Doesn't Work
================

If the driver doesn't work, you may need to alter some
settings in your computer's BIOS.
1) If there is a BIOS option to select the operating system, 
select "Other". Do not select "Windows98 / Windows 2000".
2) If there is a BIOS option called "PnP OS installed" select "No"
or "Disabled". Do not select "Yes" or "Enabled".
3) If there is a BIOS option called "AC97 audio" select "Auto"
or "Enabled". Do not select "Disabled".
4) If there is a BIOS option to assign an IRQ to "INT2" or "PINB",
make sure it is set to "Auto" or a free IRQ. Do not use "none".
5) It may also help to enable a "AC97 modem" option.

6) If you can't get it working, send me an email.
I will send you a version that has debugging support included.
After you get it, install it. Then send me a second email. 
Make sure that you attach the file ich_ac97.log that is created
in your home directory every time the driver is loaded. It
includes important debug information, like the kind of codec used.
Include the name of your motherboard and it's chipset, a URL
to the board on it's manufactor's website would be nice.
