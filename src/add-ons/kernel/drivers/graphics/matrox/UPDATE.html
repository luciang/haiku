<p><h2>Changes done for each driverversion:</h2></p>
<p><h1>head (svn 0.33, Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>G100-G200:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cards that have a MAVEN (connected) for TVout are now correctly identified as being singlehead cards. This fixes the colorpalette trouble on these cards, resulting in just the upper three colorbits working in 32bit mode, while the rest was totally unusable;
<li>Added TVout support for cards with a MAVEN (MGA_TVO) factory mounted on the 'main' graphics board (note: MGA_TVO rev B works badly still, rev C works much better: in progress);
<li>Added TVout support for cards with a MAVEN (MGA_TVO) daughter add-on board (note: MGA_TVO rev B works badly still, rev C works much better: in progress).
</ul>
<li><strong>G200-G550:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The overlay engine code now respects the B_OVERLAY_COLOR_KEY flag instead of forcing keying ON.
</ul>
<li><strong>G450:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Coldstarting now works on more cards: fixed RAM reset trouble so RAM access now works (no more ghosting on the screen).
</ul>
<li><strong>G450-G550:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hardware overlay now also works for HDTV video (720p, 1080p).
</ul>
<li><strong>General:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hook GET_ACCELERANT_DEVICE_INFO now returns more detailed info about the card in use;
<li>Hooks INIT_ACCELERANT and CLONE_ACCELERANT now enforce their correct use; returning error B_NOT_ALLOWED in case of errors;
<li>Execution of acceleration commands has been optimized: now the top-level acceleration functions are incorporated in the engine. This increases acceleration with upto some 15%, depending on CPU speed and engine load. 
</ul>
</ul>
<p><h1>mga_driver 0.26 (Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>G200-G550:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added support for MMS cards by letting non-primary adaptors use the BIOS from the primary adaptor if they don't have their own. Confirmed a G200MMS working OK on all four heads using the 'test harness' application from Be's R4 graphics driver kit. A big thanks to Cale Lewis for donating this card!
</ul>
<li><strong>General:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Several ProposeMode updates and fixes making the Matrox driver better compatible with Dualhead Setup 0.04;
<li>Added capability to driver to run without an INT assigned. Driver will now automatically disable the 'Sync_to_Retrace' function if no INT was assigned instead of not loading/running at all;
<li>Added new mga.setting ("primary") to force a certain card to be primary card in a system with multiple graphics cards: so it will display your desktop. To enable this (hack) feature uncomment this item and fill in the exact name of the card that is to be primary (as exported by the kerneldriver in /dev/graphics/). If you are going to select a card other than the one displaying your system's POST messages at bootup, make sure you also keep the default 'usebios false' setting as otherwise the card(s) aren't coldstarted by the driver.<br>
<strong>Note please:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Coldstarting doesn't work on Millenium I and Millenium II cards yet.
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><h1>mga_driver 0.20 (Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>G200-G550:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Added move_overlay() so overlay (finally) works correctly in virtualscreens.
		</ul>
	<li><strong>General:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed acceleration engine management regarding sync_to_token: no more updating glitches should occur now;
			<li>Fixed GET_TIMING_CONSTRAINTS and GET_ACCELERANT_DEVICE_INFO accelerant hooks to return valid data; updated modeline checking and modification code (used by ProposeDisplayMode) to adhere to one more timing constraint;
			<li>Added one more 4:3 aspect display mode (1400x1050) which you can use by just selecting it from the Screenprefs app, except if you use the native R5 one. Use Dualhead setup instead (for example).
		</ul>
</ul>
<p><h1>mga_driver 0.16 (Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>G450/G550:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed CRTC1 DPMS fault introduced in V0.15 (which could result in turned-off/black screen on boot)!
		</ul>
	<li><strong>General:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Expanded modelist to include suggested modes above 1600x1200 upto 2048x1536 resolution: Done by Andrew Bachmann;
			<li>CRTC timing restriction checking updated: Modelists exported adhere to every cards max. CRTC capability now: the oldest cards support upto and including 1600x1200, while the newest cards support upto and including 2048x1536 resolution.
		</ul>
</ul>
<p><h1>mga_driver 0.15 (Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>G400/G400MAX:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Secondary head (maven) sync polarity programming fixed/implemented for monitor mode: this never worked correctly yet;
			<li>Fixed TVout aspect ratio, size, position and distortions; also removed refreshrate dependancies. This means the PAL and NTSC Desktop modes 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768 are fully OK now;
			<li>Implemented the PAL and NTSC Video VCD and DVD TVout modes: being 640x480 and 720x480 for NTSC; 768x576 and 720x576 for PAL. Checkout the <a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/be-hold/BeOS/MGAdriver/tools.html#tools">tools</a> and <a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/be-hold/BeOS/MGAdriver/dvdvideo.html">VCD/DVD on TV</a> stuff;
			<li>Checked out the overscanning rubbish visible on the top of the screen on the secondary head if spaces with virtual height are used. This cannot be fixed decently for monitor mode due to a MAVEN hardware design fault; fixed TVout modes via a vertical sync 'tweak' though. Also updated the workaround code for non-virtual and virtual-width-only modes to respect RAM size and non-accelerated modes;
			<li>Updated ProposeMode RAM and virtual width requirement checks for dualhead modes.
		</ul>
	<li><strong>G450:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated ProposeMode RAM and virtual width requirement checks for dualhead modes;
			<li>Added full DPMS support for secondary head;
			<li>Disabled G400 MAVEN design fault workaround code as the new 'on die MAVEN' is OK.
		</ul>
	<li><strong>G550:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated ProposeMode RAM and virtual width requirement checks for dualhead modes;
			<li>Added full DPMS support for secondary head;
			<li>Disabled G400 MAVEN design fault workaround code as the new 'on die MAVEN' is OK.
		</ul>
	<li><strong>General:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Retrace sync fix: sync now actually happens during retrace;
			<li>BWindowScreen R3-style function update for acceleration and page flipping/virtualscreens in apps ('Allegro' update): fixed cloning accelerants, fixed acceleration in clones;
			<li>CRTC timing restriction checking updated;
			<li>Kernel driver now signals abort on not being able to setup the INT routine instead of letting the machine freeze during accelerant initialisation;
			<li>Primary head sync polarity programming fixed: this never worked correctly;
			<li>Fixed/updated DPMS functionality on primary head as only part of it was working;
			<li>DPMS compatibility update for use with sync_on_green: Secondary head DPMS remains operational; primary head will only blank the display while keeping it's sync in place;
			<li>Modified the default settings file for use of the hardcursor ('hardcursor true'). It turns out BDirectWindow windowed mode needs this setting for it to be enabled ('Chart' demo app for instance). If you want a cursor on both heads using dualhead you need to change the settings file back to 'hardcursor false' yourself now.
		</ul>

		</ul>
	<li><strong>G200:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Improved overlay support for virtual workspaces (will improve more later on).
		</ul>
	<li><strong>G400/G400MAX:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Re-implemented videoPLL setup for monitormode;
			<li>Re-implemented videoPLL setup for TVout mode;
			<li>Re-implemented TVout functionality: output quality is still the same, but some handy logging is implemented for instance now. The Linux code has gone;
			<li>Fixed the low contrast/intensity setting of the TVout picture and tuned the colorburst signal;
			<li>Improved non-coldstarted dualhead and TVout support;
			<li>BWindowScreen support update for dualhead and TVout use;
			<li>Improved hardcursor support for dualhead stretch and switch modes, in standard and virtual spaces;

		</ul>
	<li><strong>G450:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented videoPLL setup for monitor mode <strong>and</strong> TVout mode with 'on the fly' loopback filter configuration;
			<li>Checked and updated pins readout for all VCO reported specs;
			<li>Implemented basic TVout support;
			<li>Fixed a small bug in all PLL's that prevented TVout color from working correctly. This bug was also responsible for 'jumping' refreshrate changes on moving the corresponding slider in Be's screenprefs panel. The refreshrates and system speed are thus set more accurately now;
			<li>Fixed the low contrast/intensity setting of the TVout picture and tuned the colorburst signal;
			<li>Improved/fixed non-coldstarted dualhead and TVout support;
			<li>Setup TVout picture vertical sizing and positioning: the DVD and VCD modes are operational! (Checkout the <a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/be-hold/BeOS/MGAdriver/tools.html#tools">tools</a> and <a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/be-hold/BeOS/MGAdriver/dvdvideo.html">VCD/DVD on TV</a> stuff);

		</ul>
	<li><strong>G550:</strong>

		</ul>
	<li><strong>General:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented framebuffer slopspace. This 'feature' is needed for (decent) standard mode support on older cards (before G100), and also enables very flexible non-standard mode support on all cards (in horizontal pixel multiples of 8 pixels);
			<li>Implemented support for primary head 'sync on green'. The driver config file mga.settings is used to enable/disable this function. Sync on green is functional on Millenium I upto and including G200 cards. G400, G450 and G550 cards apparantly miss the needed wiring on the videocard to actually support this;
			<li>Shutdown kernel driver Matrox Mystique 170/220 recognition. These cards are not supported, so the driver may not interfere with possible other drivers that *do* support these cards;
			<li>Prevented the driver from using the motherboard interrupts IRQ0, 1 or 2  if assigned to the Matrox card: otherwise the system may crash or hang on boot. Thanks to Sunlung Suen for nailing this one;
			<li>Removed read access on a write only register. This fixes 2D acceleration on Millenium 2 cards and G100 acceleration not working if used as secondary videocard. Because this register was used incorrectly on all cards it might fix other (sporadic) problems also.
			<li>Added BeOS BWindowScreen bug workaround ('ProposeMode limitation check' setup error): BWindowScreen is working fully in every valid configuration 'guaranteed' now! 
			<li>Fixed a MOVE_DISPLAY bug: horizontal move instructions where not correctly carried out for 16 and 32bit colormodes. for 16bit moves the X-coordinate was divided by two, for 32bit moves it was divided by four. This fix definately improves support for large virtual workspaces including BWindowScreen;
			<li>Added BWindowScreen support for extremely large virtual spaces. Overlay can always be used (on G200 and later cards), 2D acceleration functions are only exported if they support a certain size;
			<li>Fixed errors in displaymode list exported by the driver: corrected 1152x864 modes timing errors; modes beyond cardspecs are nolonger exported.
		</ul>
</ul>
<p><h1>mga_driver 0.13 beta2 (Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Millenium II:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>No improvements (for this version).
		</ul>
	<li><strong>G100:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Removed another hardcursor bug that prevented it to work correctly on some occasions (bitmap trouble),
			<li>Verified and improved coldstart support via actual use as secondary videocard.
		</ul>
	<li><strong>G200:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented 'hardware zooming' in overlay. Also fixed bottom and right-most 'line' distortions sometimes visible,
			<li>Completed 'official' card coldstart and verified it via actual use as secondary videocard,
			<li>Minimized 'high-resolution video on high-resolution desktop' (downscaling) distortions in overlay by setting up G200 memory access priority. Note: This is a 'known limitation' of the G200 cards, their memory bandwidth is limited. G400 and later cards do not suffer from this on overlay...
		</ul>
	<li><strong>G400/G400MAX:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented 'hardware zooming' in overlay. Also fixed bottom and right-most 'line' distortions sometimes visible,
			<li>Completed 'official' card coldstart and verified it via actual use as secondary videocard,
			<li>Toggled (and verified) NTSC/PAL TV output so it matches with dualheadsetup setting,
			<li>Included TV-adapter cable detection (currently only used on cross-connecting heads),
			<li>Modified dualhead implementation for head cross-connecting and overlay,
			<li>Added analog amplification setting for secondary head (monitor mode: prevents analog flat-panels from being driven into saturation which resulted in bright, distorted colors).
		</ul>
	<li><strong>G450:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented 'hardware zooming' in overlay. Also fixed bottom and right-most 'line' distortions sometimes visible,
			<li>System PLL is programmed according to pins reported specs, 
			<li>Implemented full card coldstart support: Not yet verified, but should work as secondary videocard,
			<li>Included TV-adapter cable detection: Analog VGA output connector is automatically chosen like the card's BIOS does if the card has a primary DVI connector,
			<li>Extended/fixed/changed dualhead implementation for cross-connecting heads, overlay use, and (coldstarted) VGA-BIOS independent functionality (not yet verified, but should work OK).
		</ul>

		</ul>
	<li><strong>General:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Re-included the 'Be screenprefs Panel' lower-refreshrate limit at 48Hz, 'mistakenly' removed in V0.13 beta1,
			<li>Verified the high-refreshrate limits, works nicely according to specs and pins. G200 for instance can do 1600x1200x32 in max. 60Hz,
			<li>The 'mga.settings' file 'usebios' option default setting for the driver is (re)set to 'false', so the G100-G550 cards will be fully started now. Please report if you encounter problems!!
			<li>The 'mga.settings' file 'hardcursor' option default setting is (re)set to 'false', so dualhead works OK 'out of the box'. This is a failsafe setting: if you only use singlehead mode you can manually re-enable it,
			<li>Finally completed the 'migration' to the new PINS implementation. The old version is completely removed now! (pre G100 PINS readout will be implemented also, and some minor modifications might still be done in the future to support new features the driver will get.)

REMARK: Re-implementing Pins is something that has it's repercussions throughout the entire driver. Most improvements are at least somewhat connected to this. Pins describes the actual specifications of your videocard. It provides info on type, amount, speed and configuration of cardRAM. It tells the driver if TVout or DVI exist on your card. It also specifies largely what the other specifications are for every individual MGA card outthere.<br>

<li>Polarity is set for VSYNC and HSYNC
<li>refresh with low dot clock is now correct
<li>logfile now has 3 levels (1 - all, 2 - info, 3 - error)
<li>ROM is now mapped in a better way (thanx for the info)
<li>Sounds like init is failing for some G400MAX owners. Please try new version first, but if it still fails please do the following (it sets it up as a standard G400 without using the BIOS):
<ul>
<li>cd accelerent/mgag400
<li>mv mga_fake_info.c mga_info.c
</ul>
</ul>
