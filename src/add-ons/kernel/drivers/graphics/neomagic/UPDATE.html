<p><h2>Changes done for each driverversion:</h2></p>
<p><h1>head (0.06-2, Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated modelist to include one more suggested mode for 800x600 resolution: Done by Andrew Bachmann;
	<li>CRTC timing restriction checking updated: Modelists exported adhere to every cards max. CRTC capability now: the oldest cards support upto and including 1024x1000, while the newest cards support upto and including 1280x1024 resolution;
	<li>Kernel driver now signals abort on not being able to setup the INT routine instead of letting the machine freeze during accelerant initialisation;
	<li>BWindowScreen R3-style function update for acceleration (once setup) and page flipping/virtualscreens in apps ('Allegro' update): fixed cloning accelerants;
	<li>Updated acceleration engine management code;
	<li>Added partial acceleration for NM2097 and NM2160 (screen_to_screen blit).
</ul>
<p><h1>nm_driver 0.05 (Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul> 
        <li>Prevent system or video freeze on dragging files or so in tracker windows; 
        <li>BWindowScreen / Sync_to_retrace fix: prevent apps from crashing on endless waiting for retrace. Wait_for_retrace is temporary disabled now until it's actually implemented;
		<li>Sync polarity setup now actually works (external monitor only mode);
		<li>Power-up register unlocking narrowed down to overlay engine only. This should fix the screen rubbish trouble most users had with V0.04 which did not exist for them on V0.03. 
</ul>
<p><h1>nm_driver 0.04 (Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li>included hardware overlay for the B_YCbCr422 (FourCC: YUY2) colorspace;
	<li>added CRTC registers unlock command on startup.
</ul>
<p><h1>nm_driver 0.03 (Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li>virtual screens / BWindowScreen support including panning/scrolling;
	<li>colorspace selection;
	<li>colorpalette setup;
	<li>refreshrate selection in external (CRT only) mode;
	<li>resolution selection;
	<li>hardcursor support;
	<li>preliminary LCD panel centering support;
	<li>you can switch between panel and the external monitor via the special key on the laptop KB. Also the driver respects the output preselected in the BIOS. Note that the NeoMagic BIOS does the output device switch: the driver may not work correctly in all settings yet.
</ul>
<p><h1>Still todo:</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li>updates needed for LCD centering support;
	<li>fix for trouble with booting into modes above 800x600 resolution on some cards (please report this behaviour!);
	<li>shadowregister programming needed for 'full' KB switch BIOS support;
	<li>2D acceleration;
	<li>MagicMedia series overlay update: still contains errors apparantly.
</ul>
