<h2 align="center">NeoMagic MagicGraph/MagicMedia graphics driver for (open)BeOS</h2></align><br><br>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
This is the 0.05 release of the (open)BeOS NeoMagic display driver.<br>
<hr>
<h3><strong>NOTE PLEASE:</strong><br>
You use this software at your own risk! Although I don't expect it to damage your PC, videocard or Monitor, I cannot guarantee this!</h3>
<hr>
<br>
If you encounter bugs, please checkout the driver's <a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/be-hold/BeOS/NMdriver/index.html">website</a> to see if it's already on the todo list. You can also checkout the <a href="UPDATE.html">UPDATE</a> file included with this driver to see if it should have been fixed. If you think it's prudent, or if you are unsure, then please fill out the <a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/be-hold/BeOS/NMdriver/bugreport.html">bugreport</a> on the site or send me an <a href="mailto:rag.cornelissen@inter.nl.net">Email</a>. Make sure you are as precise as possible because that will make things easier to trackdown and fix...<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, now that's all said let's get to it ;-)<br>
<br>
In contrary to what I have said before you don't need to de-install official Be drivers for this driver to work correctly. This driver will install in the user part of the BeOS, so not in the system part where the official drivers are.<br>
BeOS first checks (during boot) if there are 'user-addons' that should be loaded for a device. If not, it loads it's own drivers (if any). You can select which driver should be loaded by hitting the spacebar as soon as the BeOS 'icons' screen appears. If you select <strong>disable user addons</strong> the system will load it's own drivers. If you don't do anything, the system will load the (open)BeOS NeoMagic MagicGraph/MagicMedia graphics driver.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> This might turn out to be handy if you run into trouble upon testing the driver, or if you are 'tweaking' the nm.settings file...<br>
<br><br>
<strong>actual INSTALLATION:</strong><br> 
<br> 
In a terminal switch to the 'openBeOS_Neomagic_V0.05_src' or 'openBeOS_Neomagic_V0.05_bin' folder (depending on downloaded version) and type:<br>
make install<br> 
<br> 
You have to reboot in order to load the driver. Make sure you read the <strong>Settings</strong> information below before you do that...
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<strong>DE-INSTALLATION:</strong><br> 
<br> 
In a terminal switch to the 'openBeOS_Neomagic_V0.05_src' or 'openBeOS_Neomagic_V0.05_bin' folder (depending on downloaded version) and type:
<br> 
make uninstall<br> 
<br> 
You have to reboot in order to apply the original configuration.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<strong>alternate INSTALLATION method:</strong><br> 
<br> 
In order for the install to work as described above you need to have the developer tools installed. If you don't have that, you can still do a manual install by copying some files from the 
<strong>obj/</strong> folder:<br> 
<br> 
Copy the <strong>nm.accelerant</strong> file to <strong>home/config/add-ons/accelerants/</strong><br> 
Copy the <strong>nm.driver</strong> file to <strong>home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/</strong><br> 
Copy the <strong>nm.settings</strong> file to <strong>home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/</strong><br> 
Create a <strong>shortcut</strong> in <strong>home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/graphics/</strong> which points to the file 
<strong>nm.driver</strong> you just installed.<br> 
<br> 
Now reboot and you should be using the new driver.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<strong>alternate DE-INSTALLATION method:</strong><br> 
<br> 
Just delete the three files and the shortcut created as described in the <strong>alternate INSTALLATION method
</strong>. When you're done, reboot. The original configuration will now be in effect again.<br> 
<br> 
<hr> 
<a name="settings"></a><h2>Settings:</h2><br>
Please read this information carefully *before* installing and using the (open)BeOS NeoMagic MagicGraph/MagicMedia graphics driver. It might spare you some trouble afterwards..<br>
<p>The driver uses a file named <strong>nm.settings</strong> to determine how to use your card. After installation this file will be located at <strong>home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/</strong>. How you should setup this file depends on what you want to do with the driver. While it has a 'failsave' default configuration, you might be able to do better than that... Anyway, read the nifty details below.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The driver only reads this file during it's initialisation. This means that you have to reboot in order to let changes take effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>nm.settings driver configuration:</strong><br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>memory:</strong> (disabled by default)<br>
		This option enables you to override the 'memory amount autodetection' of the driver. The driver does not need this because it's well known how much RAM every specific card contains, but you could limit the amount of RAM to a lower value than actually there to test with for instance overlay use in applications. So this option is probably only of interest to developers. Specify the RAM amount in Kb (use only 'whole' numbers!).<br>
This option is disabled by default (preceded by a '#').<br>
<li><strong>hardcursor:</strong><br>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>false:</strong><br>
		If you have trouble with the hardcursor, select <strong>hardcursor false</strong>. Make sure you let me know about the hardcursor trouble also: this should not happen!
		<li><strong>true:</strong> (default setting)<br>
		A software cursor 'flickers' a bit sometimes because it has to be redrawn constantly. So <strong>hardcursor true</strong> is the preferred setting.
	</ul>
<li><strong>logmask:</strong> (set to minimal by default)<br>
The logmask option is very handy to track down trouble in the driver. You should only enable this if you are doing so, otherwise keep it turned off because it slows down your system. (All lines have a '#' preceding 'logmask' by default.) Logging creates a logfile called <strong>nm.accelerant.log</strong> in hour <strong>~ (home)</strong> folder.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You may only enable *one* logmask-line. The value you place after it (hexadecimal 32bit) determines what will be logged. The first 7 digits determine the part of the driver that will be logging, the last single digit determines the level of logging (like 'all messages', or only 'error messages').
</ul>
<li><strong>dumprom:</strong><br>
Dumprom is another 'tool' for bug-tracking purposes.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>false:</strong> (default setting)<br>
		Keep it set to <strong>dumprom false</strong>, unless you want the driver to dump the contents of your VGA BIOS ROM in a file.
		<li><strong>true:</strong><br>
		<strong>dumprom true</strong> lets the driver dump a copy of your VGA BIOS in a file called <strong>nm.rom</strong> in your <strong>~ (home)</strong> folder.
	</ul>
</ul>
