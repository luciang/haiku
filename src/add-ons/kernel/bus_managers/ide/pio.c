	PIO data transmission

	This file is more difficult then you might expect as the SCSI system
	uses physical addresses everywhere which have to be mapped into 
	virtual address space during transmission. Additionally, during ATAPI
	commands we may have to transmit more data then exist because the
	data len specified by the command doesn't need to be the same as 
	of the data buffer provided.
	
	The handling of S/G entries of odd size may look superfluous as the 
	SCSI bus manager can take care of that. In general, this would be possible
	as most controllers need even alignment for DMA as well, but some can
	handle _any_ S/G list and it wouldn't be sensitive to enforce stricter
	alignement just for some rare PIO transmissions.
	
	Little hint for the meaning of "transferred": this is the number of bytes
	sent over the bus. For read-transmissions, this may be one more then copied
	into the buffer (the extra byte read is stored in device->odd_byte), for
	write-transmissions, this may be one less (the waiting byte is pending in
	device->odd_byte).
	
	In terms of error handling: we don't bother checking transmission of every
	single byte via read/write_pio(). At least at the end of the request, when 
	the status bits are verified, we will see that something has gone wrong.
	
	TBD: S/G entries may have odd start address. For non-Intel architecture
	we either have to copy data to an aligned buffer or have to modify 
	PIO-handling in controller drivers.
