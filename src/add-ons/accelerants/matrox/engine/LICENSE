The files in this directory (and any other files beginning with "mga_") are independent from Be's sample code

Basically, freely copy them, edit them etc. Just do not claim you wrote them. 

Will think of something more official to put here later:)

Notes: This excludes the maven_hack port of matroxfb's maven stuff - see notes in that file for info.
