Driver for FujiFilm FinePix digital cameras in PcCam (WebCam) mode. Version 0.1.1

This driver is for FinePix cameras with a USB connection.

It should hopefully work with the following cameras under Zeta:

Fujifilm FinePix 4800
Fujifilm FinePix A202
Fujifilm FinePix A203
Fujifilm FinePix A204
Fujifilm FinePix A205
Fujifilm FinePix A210
Fujifilm FinePix A303
Fujifilm FinePix A310
Fujifilm FinePix F401
Fujifilm FinePix F402
Fujifilm FinePix F410
Fujifilm FinePix F601
Fujifilm FinePix F700
Fujifilm FinePix M603
Fujifilm FinePix S3000
Fujifilm FinePix S304
Fujifilm FinePix S5000
Fujifilm FinePix S602
Fujifilm FinePix S7000

, only tested with FinePix S602Zoom on Zeta 1.1 though.

TEST
You can test if it works with your camera by connecting the camera and running FinePixTest in the Terminal. It should output lots of debug info and save one image in the same folder it's run from. (PS the test might not work after the media addon is installed, as that then takes control over the camera.)

INSTALLATION
Drop the FinePix.media_addon on the "Drop media_addon here to install" link, or copy manually to /boot/home/config/add-ons/media. Then Restart Media Services in the Media preferences, and the FinePixProducer should appear as a Video Input under Video Settings.

USAGE
Should (hopefully) work with all applications that accept video input, tested with CodyCam and Cortex.

REMOVAL
Delete FinePix.media_addon from /boot/home/config/add-ons/media

KNOWN BUGS
Might crash the media_addon_server if camera is disconnected while in use or if application tries to access a camera that is not connected. This can be cleared up by restarting the media services in Media preferences.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Uses the USBKit. The media addon part is heavily based on the VideoProducer sample code from Be, and the driver is partially based on the Linux FinePix driver by Frank Zago and information gathered with the handy SnoopyPro USB Sniffer tool for Windows.

FUTURE PLANS
Make it harder to crash :-) Maybe move from USBKit to kernel mode for the actual driver part.
