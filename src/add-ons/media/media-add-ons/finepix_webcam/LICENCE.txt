From Ã˜yvind Smestad (o.smestad AT gmail.com):

When it comes to licencing, the media addon part is heavily based on
the VideoProducer sample code from Be (I don't remember their exact
licensing terms, but they were quite liberal weren't they?). The
driver part is partially based on the Linux FinePix driver by Frank
Zago (http://www.zago.net/v4l2/finepix/ -
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpix/), that is where the Linux JPEG
code came from and also where I got the device IDs. If the JPEG part
is removed I don't think there should be enough left there to break
the GPL, as the rest of the code is probably more "inspired by" than
"copied from" the Linux driver. At least I remember having to monitor
the USB traffic under Windows to get the setup commands right, and I
also think there were some articles on writing a BeOS webcam driver
and on using the USBKit that I used as references.

I hope that made it a bit more clear!
As for what I did, I'm more than happy for it to be under MIT licence.
