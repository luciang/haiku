// This class is designed to work with the generic USB input device driver
// the driver creates an entry in /dev/input/???
// clients can open and read from the device file, the driver will than
// block on waiting for an interrupt transfer (timeout is 500 ms) and write
// the received data to the supplied buffer. In front of the buffer, it will
// write vendorID, productID and maxPacketSize, so you can read from the file
// with a buffer of just enough size to contain these fields, in this case, no
// interrupt transfer will be triggered, and the client can then configure itself
// with a more appropriate setup.
