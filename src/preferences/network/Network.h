/*General notes:
	_ Generates two warnings when compiling which you don't have to care about. 	
	_ The way the net_server is restarted might not be very good as it takes 0.10s
		contrarely to Be's original ones that takes few seconds and does many more 
		things that I don't know yet. Will be improved ASAP.(As soon as I know how 
		tings are working...) 
	_ Custom button actually add an interface so I changed his label to "Add"
		which make it clearer.
	_ Custom/Add button does nothing because of next line.
	_ Don't know where to find the "interface types".	
	_ Clear button does nothing as I couldn't find his utility.
	_ Where to find the App's icon ? Ask Creative Design Team ?
	_ Is there any "OBOS header" to insert on top of each sheet?
