The provider database is simply a collection of files with attributes. To add
new provider to the image rdef files are used. In the jam file you have to add
the new provider name. Here an example rdef file:
 
resource(1, "Provider") "gmx.de";
resource(2, "POP Server") "pop.gmx.net";
resource(3, "IMAP Server") "imap.gmx.net";
resource(4, "SMTP Server") "mail.gmx.de";
resource(5, "POP Authentification") 0;
resource(6, "SMTP Authentification") 0;
resource(7, "Username Pattern") 0;
 
 
you can pass the following options to the last three items:
 
"POP Authentification":
	0	plain text
	1	APOP
 
"SMTP Authentification":
	0	none
	1	ESMTP
	2	POP3 before SMTP
 
"Username Pattern":
	0	username is the email address (default)
	1	username is the local-part of the email address local-part@domain.net
	2	no username is proposed
