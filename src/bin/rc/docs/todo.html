<H1>Ye Olde To Do List</H1>

<P>What will future versions of rc bring? Here are some ideas.</P>

<UL>

<LI>Attributes, so you can also use rdef scripts to add attributes to your files instead of (or in addition to) resources.<BR>&nbsp;</LI> 

<LI>Expand the expressions to handle other data types besides integer data. This would include floating point (+ - * /), string (+), raw (+), and booleans (! &amp;&amp; ||).<BR>&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>Allow users to create their own symbolic constants.</LI>
