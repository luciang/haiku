The files in this directory are shared between the fileutils, sh-utils,
and textutils packages.

These files are used by a program called aclocal (part of the GNU automake
package).  aclocal uses these files to create aclocal.m4 which is in turn
used by autoconf to create the configure script at the top level in
this distribution.

The Makefile.am file in this directory is automatically generated
from the template file, Makefile.am.in.
