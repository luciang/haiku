restore djgpp, eventually
merge TODO lists
add unit tests for lib/*.c
rewrite lib/ftw.c not to use explicit recursion, and then use nftw in
  chown, chgrp, chmod, du

strip: add an option to specify the program used to strip binaries.
  suggestion from Karl Berry

doc/coreutils.texi:
  Address this comment: FIXME: mv's behavior in this case is system-dependent
  Better still: fix the code so it's *not* system-dependent.

implement --target-directory=DIR for install (per texinfo documentation)

ls: add --format=FORMAT option that controls how each line is printed.

cp --no-preserve=X should not attempt to preserve attribute X
  reported by Andreas Schwab

copy.c: Address the FIXME-maybe comment in copy_internal.
And once that's done, add an exclusion so that `cp --link'
no longer incurs the overhead of saving src. dev/ino and dest. filename
in the hash table.

Apply suggestion from Paul Jarc to use something along the
lines of http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/setuidgid.html to avoid
kludges (as in tests/rm/fail-2eperm) when running tests as root.

See if we can be consistent about where --verbose sends its output:
  These all send --verbose output to stdout:
    head, tail, rm, cp, mv, ln, chmod, chown, chgrp, install, ln
  These send it to stderr:
    shred mkdir split
  readlink is different

Write an autoconf test to work around build failure in HPUX's 64-bit mode.
See notes in README -- and remove them once there's a work-around.

after 5.0, change doc strings (like df, ls, etc) not to use `,'
as thousands separator in e.g. 1,000,000.  Instead, do this:

  SIZE may be (or may be an integer optionally followed by) one of following:
  kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024 and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

Integrate use of sendfile, suggested here:

Should printf '\0123' print "\n3"?
  per report from TAKAI Kousuke on Mar 27
  http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-03/index.html

printf: consider adapting builtins/printf.def from bash

df: add `--total' option, suggested here http://bugs.debian.org/186007

Martin Michlmayr's patch to provide ls with `--sort directory' option

seq: give better diagnostics for invalid formats:
   e.g. no or too many % directives
seq: consider allowing format string to contain no %-directives

dd: consider adding an option to suppress `bytes/block read/written'
output to stderr.  Suggested here:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=165045

nl: fix this bug:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=177256
  # printf 'a\n\n'|nl|cat -A
     1^Ia$
         $
  $

m4: rename all macros that start with AC_ to start with another prefix

Consider using an autoconf test and rename wrapper to make mv work
properly (by unlinking a) in cases like this:
  : > a; ln a b; mv a b
