** 14-Oct-2001, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.7
 - (main, args) New options '--no-warn-exit' to return a zero exitcode
     ('success') when a warning was generated (for use in Makefiles).
 - (main, args) New options '--ignore-missing' to ignore missing include
     files (apart from printing a diagnostic).
 - (Makefile, libglob/Makefile) Added x86->PPC cross-compilation.

** 01-Mar-2000, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.6
 - (main, args, nodes) New option '--select' to narrow the dependency
     generation to a few selected files.
 - (Makefile, libglob/Makefile) Added crosscompilation PPC->x86.

** 03-Feb-1999, Lars Düning **
 - (main, args) When out of memory, the error message also contains a slightly
     cryptic hint where the program failed.
 - (Makefile) The 'archive' target also creates a checksum file for the
     archive, using the /bin/cksum command.
     The .dependencies are included only when no 'clean' or 'clobber' is
     requested (this solves the behavior Dianne noticed, that a 'make clean'
     first recreates .dependencies only to delete it again).

** 02-Feb-1999, Lars Düning **
 - (args.*) All information about an include directory is now combined
     in one structure.
 - (main.c, nodes.*) Rewrote the file identification and searching routines,
     the old code failed to discriminate files which are included from
     different directories.
 - (util.*) New.

 - (getargs.c) A long option matched even when only the first characters
     were given. A test for the proper length corrected this.

** 25-Nov-1998, Lars Düning **
 - (getargs.c) A long option matched even when only the first characters
     were given. A test for the proper length corrected this.

** 01-Nov-1998, Lars Düning **
 - (getargs.c) If a value for an option was missing, the parser printed
     the wrong option name in the error message.

** 25-Oct-1998, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.4.5
 - (Makefile, libglob/Makefile) Adapted for R4 compilations.
 - (Makefile) Improved the dependency generation: dependencies are
     kept in the file .dependencies; and the rule is clever enough
     to fall back to the compiler facilities if mkdepend is not
     on the system.
 - (getargs) Separated the commandline parser into here.
 - (args) New options '--longhelp' to print a long help text, and
     '--version' to print the program version.
     '--include' distinguishes between normal and system include paths.
 - (main) Default file suffixes now also cover a whole range of
     C++ suffixes (.cc, .cpp, .cxx, .cc).
     Filenames with embedded spaces are written in quotes.
 - (nodes, reader, main) Added support for system includes.

** 15-Oct-1998, Lars Düning **
 - (main.c) The name for the makefile backup was allocated one character
     too short.

** 04-Jul-1998, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.4
   RCS-Name is 'Rel-1_4', State is 'Rel'.
 - Converted the program to BeOS. I decided to not keep the old Amiga
   code - it's available on Aminet and I won't further develop it anyway.
   New files: LICENSE.
   Changed files: Just about everything else.
 - Added libglob/ for filename globbing.

** 02-Mar-1996, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.3
 - Oops, when confronted with target/source relations, MkDepend put the
   source name into the dependency list as well. Though intentional, this
   had the potential to confuse implicit make rules. Now this behaviour
   is optional, triggered by specifying '+' with the object extension.
   (main.c, args.ch)
 - RCS tweaks to the Makefiles.

** 25-Feb-1996, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.2
 - main.c (output_tree, output): Added output of includers of a file.
 - main.c (readfiles): If a file can't be found, it's users known so far
     are printed in the warning notice.
 - nodes.c,h: Added .pUsers (List of includers of this file) to the Node
     structure, extended routines nodes_depend() and nodes_deplist()
     accordingly.
 - Put under RCS (the Makefiles still need tweaking for this, though).

** 04-Feb-1996, Lars Düning **
 - main.c (output, getargs, main): The program is now able to write the
     list of dependencies into a separate file as well.
 - main.c (output_tree): New to write the dependency tree into a file.
 - args.ch, main.c: Exported argument parsing into args.c.
 - reader.c (reader_openrw): Immediate writing if no file to read is
     opened is now possible.

** 13-Oct-1995, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.1
 - reader.c (reader_copymake2): Copies the remainder of the original
     Makefile starting with the second tagline.

** 12-Oct-1995, Lars Düning **
 - main.c (make_objname): %p pattern expanded to %[-][<][<number>]p.
 - Makefile, DMakefile: Making the 'archive' missed some files.

** 18-Sep-1995, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.0
