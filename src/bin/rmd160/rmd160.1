.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrmd160\fP generates and checks RIPEMD-160 message digests. These 
message digests are 160-bit signatures of the input files. \fBrmd160\fP
can be used to verify the integrity of binaries posted to usenet
newsgroups or files made available for distribution via anonymous ftp.
.PP
Message digests for a tree of files can be generated with
a command similar to the following:	
.PP
        find . -type f -print | xargs md5sum
.PP
The output of this command is suitable as input for the \fB-c\fP
option.
 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Check message digests. Input is taken from standard input or from the
first file specified on the command line. The input should be in the
same format as the message digest output generated by \fBrmd160\fP
when this option is not specified.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose. Print all file names when checking and the result of each
message digest check. If this option is not specified then only files
that failed the check will be printed.
.TP
.B \-b
Read files in binary mode. This option has no effect on Unix systems.
.SH RETURN VALUES
Status codes returned by \fBrmd160\fP:
.TP
.B 2 
fatal or I/O related errors
.TP
.B 1 
one or more files failed the message digest check
.TP
.B 0 
no errors and all files passed the message digest check
