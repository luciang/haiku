// ToDo: we probably need to set some standard slots (like it's done in BeOS)!
// 	Slot 1 is obviously the thread ID, but there are 8 pre-allocated slots in BeOS.
//	I have no idea what the other slots are used for; they are all NULL when the
//	thread has just started, but slots 0 & 1.
//	Slot 0 seems to be an address somewhere on the stack. Another slot is most probably
//	reserved for "errno", the others could have been used to make some POSIX calls
//	thread-safe - but we also have to find out which supposely non-thread-safe POSIX
//	calls are thread-safe in BeOS.
