 *            info: out - the structure to hold the cpuid information
 *    eax_register: in  - the value to place in eax before invoking 'cpuid'
 *         cpu_num: in  - the number of the cpu to gather information about
 *                        (currently not used)

 *  Note: the stage2 bootloader already verifies at startup time that the
 *  'cpuid' instruction can be called by the host computer, so no checking
 *  for this is done here.
