1) Need to make the paging daemon load the pages in, using semaphores.
2) See how unresolvable page faults and permissions errors are handled - need to properly handle
3) Implment cloneArea
4) Tests are not done. 
	Test:
		getAreaInfo
		getNextAreaInfo
		cloneArea
		resizeArea
		setAreaProtection
		mmap
		paging

5) Improve locking (remains to be seen - works ok so far)
6) I use new and delete. I know that doesn't work in kernel land. Not too tough to change, though.  
7) There is no arch-level integration. This is to be tested (to death) in user land first.  * == can not be done in user land.
