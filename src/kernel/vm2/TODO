*1) There is no arch-level integration. This is to be tested (to death) in user land first.  
2) Tests are not done. Barely started.  
3) Improve locking

5) I use new and delete. I know that doesn't work in kernel land. Not too tough to change, though.  
6) Need to make the paging daemon load the pages in, using semaphores.

* == can not be done in user land.
