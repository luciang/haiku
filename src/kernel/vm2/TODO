1) Need to make the paging daemon load the pages in, using semaphores.
	-- Looks like we *don't* have to do this, based on what is done in NewOS. Need to consult...
2) Make the caching and the VM (mmap) work together so that an mmap'ed file and a cached file will not race.
	-- Maybe a vnodeManager or a lookup in a hash table or something so that we can tell if someone is already caching this vnode.
		This could get a little tricky wrt permissions and all...
3) Change the architecture so that instead of multiple threads of tests, we have multiple apps of tests...
4) Tests are not done. 
	Test:
		getNextAreaInfo
		cloneArea
		resizeArea
		setAreaProtection
		mmap / munmap
		paging
		disk caching

5) Improve locking (remains to be seen - works ok so far)
6) See how unresolvable page faults and permissions errors are handled - need to properly handle
	- This may have to come at HW integration time, since they will be app signals, etc...
7) There is no arch-level integration. This is to be tested (to death) in user land first.  * == can not be done in user land.
