1) Must lock original area when clone()ing. Sigh. Also must add ability to clone other process' areas. The issue here is that areaManager is finding the areas. Need to keep a global list of areas for this. An area might well work. 
2) Add statistics counting for copy in/out
3) Tests are not done. 
	Test:
		getNextAreaInfo
		cloneArea
		resizeArea
		setAreaProtection
		mmap / munmap
		paging
		disk caching
4) Change the architecture so that instead of multiple threads of tests, we have multiple apps of tests...

5) Need to make the paging daemon load the pages in, using semaphores.
	-- Looks like we *don't* have to do this, based on what is done in NewOS. Need to consult...
6) See how unresolvable page faults and permissions errors are handled - need to properly handle
	- This may have to come at HW integration time, since they will be app signals, etc...
7) There is no arch-level integration. This is to be tested (to death) in user land first.  * == can not be done in user land.
