1) Implement the sharing methodology of mmap (PRIVATE vs SHARED, etc)
2) Change the architecture so that instead of multiple threads of tests, we have multiple apps of tests...
3) Tests are not done. 
	Test:
		getNextAreaInfo
		cloneArea
		resizeArea
		setAreaProtection
		mmap / munmap
		paging
		disk caching

4) See how unresolvable page faults and permissions errors are handled - need to properly handle *
	- This may have to come at HW integration time, since they will be app signals, etc...
5) There is no arch-level integration. This is to be tested (to death) in user land first.  * == can not be done in user land.
