/*!	\class EventQueue
	\brief A class providing a mechanism for executing events at specified
		   times.

	The class' interface is quite small. It basically features methods to
	add or remove an event or to modify an event's time. It is derived from
	BLocker to inherit a locking mechanism needed to serialize the access to
	its member variables (especially the event list).

	The queue runs an own thread (in _EventLooper()), which executes the
	events at the right times. The execution of an event consists of invoking
	its Event::Do() method. If the event's Event::IsAutoDelete() or its Do()
	method return \c true, the event object is deleted after execution. In
	any case the event is removed from the list before it is executed. The
	queue is not locked while an event is executed.

	The event list (\a fEvents) is ordered ascendingly by time. The thread
	uses a semaphore (\a fLooperControl) to wait (time out) for the next
	event. This semaphore is released to indicate changes to the event list.
*/

/*!	\var thread_id EventQueue::fEventLooper

/*!	\var sem_id EventQueue::fLooperControl
	\brief Queue thread control semaphore.

	The semaphore is initialized with count \c 0 and used by the queue's
	thread for timing out at the time when the next event has to be executed.
	If the event list is changed by another thread and that changed the time
	of the next event the semaphore is released (_Reschedule()).
