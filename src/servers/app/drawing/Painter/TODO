Test:

* "composite" alpha blending modes



Implement:

(* handling of other BBitmap colorspaces)



Improve:

* make more special verions of DrawingModes for B_SOLID_* patterns

* fast versions of nearest neighbor upscaling / downscaling of BBitmaps

* fast versions of bilinear scaling of BBitmaps
