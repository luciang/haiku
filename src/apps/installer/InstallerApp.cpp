"IMPORTANT INFORMATION BEFORE INSTALLING HAIKU\n\n"

"This is alpha-quality software! It means there is a high risk of losing "
"important data. Make frequent backups! You have been warned.\n\n"

"1)  If you are installing Haiku onto real hardware (not inside an emulator) "
"it is recommended that you have already prepared a hard disk partition. The "
"Installer and the DriveSetup tool offer to initialize existing partitions "
"with the Haiku native filesystem, but the options to change the actual "
"partition layout may not have been tested on a sufficiently great variaty of "
"computer installations so we do not recommend using it.\n"
"If you have not created a partition yet, simply reboot, create the partition "
"using whatever tool you feel most comfortable with, and reboot into Haiku to "
"continue with the installation. You could for example use the GParted "
"Live-CD, it can also resize existing partitions to make room.\n\n"

"2)  The Installer will take no steps to integrate Haiku into an existig boot "
"menu. The Haiku partition itself will be made bootable. If you have GRUB "
"already installed, edit your /boot/grub/menu.1st by launching your favorite "
"editor from a Terminal like this:\n\n"

"\tsudo <your favorite text editor> /boot/grub/menu.lst\n\n"

"You'll note that GRUB uses a different naming strategy for hard drives than "
"Linux.\n\n"

"With GRUB it's: (hdN,n)\n\n"

"All harddisks start with \"hd\"\n"
"\"N\" is the hard disk number, starting with \"0\".\n"
"\"n\" is the partition number, also starting with \"0\".\n"
"The first logical partition always has the number 4, regardless of the "
"number of primary partitions.\n\n"

"So behind the other menu entries towards the bottom of the file, add "
"something similar to these lines:\n\n"

"\t# Haiku on /dev/sda7\n"
"\ttitle\t\t\t\tHaiku\n"
"\trootnoverify\t\t(hd0,6)\n"
"\tchainloader\t\t+1\n\n"

"You can see the correct partition in gparted for example.\n\n"

"3)  When you successfully boot into Haiku for the first time, make sure to read "
"our \"Welcome\" documentation, there is a link on the Desktop.\n\n"

"Have fun and thanks a lot for trying out Haiku! We hope you like it!"
