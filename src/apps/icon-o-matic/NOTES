--------- random thoughts


* works a bit like WonderBrush

* list of vector path objects [done]

* tree of object instances, such that the same vector path
  object can be visible at different locations with different
  fill styles [done]

* instances of paths can have additional vector transformers [done]

* "add points" mode is problematic when having multiple manipulators for
  different paths showing at the same time...

* solve the problem of individual gradient transformation per shape
  -> introduce "StyleInstance", a Shape would not reference a Style
  directly but via a StyleInstance... this object can have additional
  information like the gradient transformation

* IconRenderer should construct a separate StyleManager and append
  the styles in the order of shapes, also adding styles multiple
  times, if two or more shapes use the same style (the compound shape
  rendering uses the style index for z ordering) [done]

* add more functionality to Transformer/VertexSource interface:
  - (inverse) Transformation
  - Cloning

* add more powerful listener interface to Shape
  (TransformerAdded()/Removed()...)

* implement commands for the newly added editing features


--------- user interface

* list of global vector paths [done]

* list of shapes [done]

* list of paths used by shape, but it could also be done such that
  used paths are marked in the global list when a shape is selected [done]

* list of transformers attached to the selected shape

* area for styles, style is either solid color or gradient


--------- icon format

* 192 "built-in" (pre-defined) style definitions
* up to 64 additional style definitions per document
* referencing of fill style by uint8 id
* solid colors and different types of gradients
* uint8 precision for coordinates on a 64x64 virtual pixel grid
(* removal (freezing) of transformations at export time
	not sure about this one, it would remove the possiblity
	to store vector path only once for referenced objects)
* IFF type chunk format


--------- rendering

* compound shape single pass rendering [done]
* auto hinting (aligning to pixels) of marked shapes
