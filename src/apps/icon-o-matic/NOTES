--------- random thoughts


* works a bit like WonderBrush

* list of vector path objects

* tree of object instances, such that the same vector path
  object can be visible at different locations with different fill styles

* instances of paths can have additional vector transformers

* "add points" mode is problematic when having multiple manipulators for
  different paths showing at the same time...


--------- icon format

* 192 "built-in" (pre-defined) style definitions
* up to 64 additional style definitions per document
* solid colors and different types of gradients
* uint8 precision for coordinates on a 64x64 virtual pixel grid
(* removal (freezing) of transformations at export time
	not sure about this one, it would remove the possiblity
	to store vector path only once for referenced objects)
* referencing of fill style by uint8 id
* IFF type chunk format


--------- rendering

* compound shape single pass rendering (if possible)
* auto hinting (aligning to pixels) of marked shapes
