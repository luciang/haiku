<h1>Haiku MIDI Player</h1>

<p>This is a simple application to play MIDI songs.</p>

<p>Differences with the BeOS R5 MidiPlayer:</p>

<ul>
<li>User interface looks slightly different (better?)</li>
<li>Play and Stop are now one and the same button.</li>
<li>There is no Open File... button. You open MIDI songs by dragging them into the window.</li>
<li>There is no Live Input feature.</li>
<li>You cannot set the Quality of the sound (always 44100 Hz).</li>
</ul>

<p>If people really <i>really</i> want these missing features, then feel free to add them :-)</p>

<p>Note: The code can be a little tricky at times, since it uses fire-and-forget threads to load new songs and to stop playback. The reason for this is the scope: we want to keep repainting the scope view even when fading out a song (because this looks cool), but fading blocks the calling thread. If we were to block the window's looper, then the scope wouldn't repaint during the fade-out. So we fade using a separate thread instead. Unfortunately, this makes the code much less clean as it introduces several race conditions. Yech. See the source for more details.</p>
