A while ago I posted a UUDECODE program, written in Microsoft Basic,
to net.sources.  Judging from the number of replies I had, people
are finding this useful if they don't have access to the public
domain UUDECODE, or to a C compiler.

I found one or two problems recently; the main one was that it would
not create an output file of more than 64K due to an undocumented
feature of MS-BASIC.  Here is a corrected version; as always, I
suggest you compile it if you want the run time to be finite.
