	--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.

2003-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Change ls -H back to the way it was yesterday, since this is
	compatible with FreeBSD and the POSIX spec is confusing
	and somewhat contradictory.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (Which files are listed, General output
	formatting): Undo last change.

2003-01-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Add support for locale-specific size indications (e.g.,
	thousands-separators) and for explicit size suffixes on output.

	* coreutils.texi (Block size): Say that:
	This affects display format as well as block size.
	Fractional block counts are rounded up.
	ls file size blocksize defaults to 1.
	A block size spec preceded by ' generates thousands separators.
	A suffix without a preceding integer generates suffixes.
	(tail invocation): 32k -> 32 KiB.
	(What information is listed): ls -h is now equivalent to
	ls --block-size=human, and ls -H is now equivalent to
	ls --block-size=si.  Displayed file size is now always affected by
	--block-size.

	POSIX 1003.1-2001:
	  - Do not adjust scheduling priority.

	Fix some related minor bugs: --no-dereference is no longer
