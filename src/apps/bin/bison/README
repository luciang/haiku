See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation instructions.
See the file doc/FAQ for frequently asked questions.

Bison requires GNU m4 1.4 (or later, if a later version of GNU m4
becomes available).  The following m4 patches are recommended:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=92629
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=211477

Older versions of Sun Forte Developer 6 update 2 have a compiler bug
that cause "make check" to fail with a "Encounter BINCL entry"
diagnostic.  To fix the bug, update to the latest set of Solaris and
Forte patches recommended by Sun.

VMS and MS-DOS builds are probably broken right now.  If you are able
to build Bison on either platform and you need to make changes to do
so, please submit those changes as a bug report.  On VMS, you will
probably have to create Makefile from Makefile.in by hand.  Remember
to do `SET COMMAND BISON' to install the data in `BISON.CLD'.

Send bug reports to <bug-bison@gnu.org>.  Please include the version
number from `bison --version', and a complete, self-contained test
case in each bug report.

If you have questions about using Bison which the documentation does
not answer, send mail to <help-bison@gnu.org>.
