Add Deskbar replicant.

I hope it is not too annoying that the user cannot select an alternative interface for connecting. The problem lies in the stack's concept that everything is an add-on. We cannot know if the connection-initiating packet type is supported by the alternative interface (or, we could, but we would have to load (and write) many add-ons that understand how the stack modules work).
This problem is minimised by showing the device view which allows changing the phone number for modems, for example.

Add some indicator to the add-ons message that says we are ppp_up, not the preflet.
