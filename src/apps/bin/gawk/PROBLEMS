This is a list of known problems in gawk 3.1.
I don't know when this will be fixed, if ever.  See also FUTURES
and the gawk.texi doc for other things that need doing.

1. The interactions with the lexer and yyerror need reworking. It is possible
   to get line numbers that are one line off if --compat or --posix is
   true and either `nextfile' or `delete array' are used.

   Really the whole lexical analysis stuff needs reworking.
