<H1>WebWatch 1.5</H1>

<P>Released on Thursday, 13 February 2003<BR>
Created by <A HREF="mailto:mahlzeit@users.sourceforge.net">Matthijs

<H3>What is it</H3>

<P>WebWatch is an unofficial port of Swatch's Internet Time utility for BeOS
R5 or higher that runs inside the Deskbar.</P>

<P>Someone at Swatch (you know, the company that makes the watches) came up
with an idea for a universal time format that eliminates time zones and
geographical borders. The idea is very simple: time is no longer measured in
hours, minutes, and seconds, but in "beats." A single day consists of 1000
beats, so each beat corresponds to 1 minute and 26.4 seconds.</P>

<P>This "Internet Time" is the same all over the world, because it is measured
relatively to something called the Biel Mean Time (BMT), a new meridian that
lies in Switzerland. A day in Internet Time begins at midnight BMT, or @000
Swatch Beats, 12 noon is equivalent to @500 beats, and so on. So if it's @812
at my place, it's also 812 beats at yours and everyone else's.</P>

<P>Please check out the <A HREF="http://www.swatch.com">Swatch website</A>
for more information.</P>

<H3>How to use it</H3>

<P>Simply double-click the WebWatch icon to install WebWatch into the Deskbar.
To get rid of it, right-click <CODE>WebWatch</CODE> in the Deskbar and select
the <CODE>Quit</CODE> option from the pop-up menu.</P>

<H3>History</H3>

<P><I>Version 1.5 (Thursday, 13 February 2003)</I></P>

<UL>
<LI>Cleaned up the source code.</LI>
<LI>Now uses the plain font, not the bold font.</LI>
</UL>

<P><I>Version 1.4 (Saturday, 9 December 2000)</I></P>

<UL>
<LI>With certain fonts, WebWatch didn't always fit in the Deskbar.</LI>
</UL>

<P><I>Version 1.3 (Sunday, 26 November 2000)</I></P>

<UL>
<LI>The time is now written using a bold font, making it better readable.</LI>
<LI>Thanks to Jason Parks for turning WebWatch into a real Deskbar add-on.
Because of this, WebWatch no longer needs to be installed in the
UserBootscript; the Deskbar starts it automatically. This also means that
WebWatch is now BeOS R5 or higher only.</LI>
</UL>

<P><I>Version 1.2 (Tuesday, 26 September 2000)</I></P>

<UL>
<LI>Finally fixed a long-standing bug with WebWatch's background color. Now it
uses the same color as the Deskbar.</LI>
</UL>

<P><I>Version 1.1 (Tuesday, 28 March 2000)</I></P>

<UL> 
<LI>New release for BeOS R5. Older versions of WebWatch came with source 
code only, which was automatically compiled during installation. However, 
because of header file changes between R5 and older versions of the BeOS, 
and because the free version of BeOS R5 doesn't necessarily include 
development tools, WebWatch 1.1 is already compiled. This means that it 
only runs on the Intel platform, since I don't have a PowerPC machine.</LI>
</UL> 

<P><I>Version 1.0 (Saturday, 14 August 1999)</I></P>

<UL> 
<LI>First version.</LI>
</UL>
