For the tests to run properly on BeOS, you need to prepare a few things.

1.) make sure your target is "r5" (if your target is "bone", you need to adjust the "run" scripts)

2.) build the Haiku registrar (from anywhere in the Haiku tree):
jam haiku_registrar

3.) build the Haiku app_server (from anywhere in the Haiku tree):
jam haiku_app_server

4.) make links to some Haiku libs in your ~/config/lib folder. The tests link to libopenbeos.so, haiku_app_server links to libhaikuappserver.so, libhwinterface.so, libhwinterfaceimpl.so, libpng.so and libfreetype.so. You will find these libs in the distro folder for your target after you build the haiku_app_server.

5.) build the test app you want to run

Each test app folder contains a script "run", which launches the Haiku app_server and a second later the test app which connects to it.

Have fun!
