For the tests to run properly on BeOS, you need to prepare a few things.

There is a pseudo target "install-test-apps" which needs to be built like this:

$ TARGET_PLATFORM=r5 jam install-test-apps

This will build "haiku_registrar", "haiku_app_server", the needed libs and some test apps and install all into "generated/tests/apps".

Each test app folder contains a script "run", which launches the Haiku app_server and a second later the test app which connects to it.

Have fun!
