* The "brilliant" way to ensure that there is only one UserlandFS (dispatcher)
  server doesn't work. BClipboard::Lock() is only application local.
* support for reading multiple directory entries, even if the client FS doesn't
  support it
* pass UID and GID with each request to make them available in userland
