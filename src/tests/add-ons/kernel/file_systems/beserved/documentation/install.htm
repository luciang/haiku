            The BeOS verions of BeServed are provided in standard SoftwareValet-compatible
            packages.  Simply double-click on the downloaded file to perform the installation.
            You may select whether you are installing the entire package, or client-only
            utilities.  Selecting client-only should be used when you want to browse files
            on other computers, but not share any local files with others.

            The Linux file you will receive is called <i>bs-linux-rh-i386.tar.gz</i>.  Once
            downloaded, create a folder in which you wish to have BeServed installed, as in:<br>
            <pre>mkdir /usr/local/BeServed</pre>
            Then, move the installation file into that folder and change the current working folder
            to that location.
            <pre>mv bs-linux-rh-i386.tar.gz /usr/local/BeServed
cd /usr/local/BeServed</pre>
            Now, uncompress the installation files using the Linux tar command.  Since the file you
            download will be both archived and compress, you'll need to specify the -z and -x options,
            or run <i>gunzip</i> before running tar.<br>
            <pre>tar -zxf bs-linux-rh-i386.tar.gz</pre>
            Several files will be uncompressed.  Run the install.sh file to perform the necessary
            installation procedures.<br>
            <pre>./install.sh</pre>
            BeServed should now be installed as a default daemon on your Linux system, it should
            be running, and will be started each time the system is booted.  You can now delete the
            original file you downloaded.<br>
            <pre>rm -f bs-linux-rh-i386.tar.gz</pre>
            <br>

            The FreeBSD file you will receive is called <i>bs-freebsd-i386.tar.gz</i>.  Once
            downloaded, create a folder in which you wish to have BeServed installed, as in:<br>
            <pre>mkdir /usr/local/BeServed</pre>
            Then, move the installation file into that folder and change the current working folder
            to that location.
            <pre>mv bs-freebsd-i386.tar.gz /usr/local/BeServed
cd /usr/local/BeServed</pre>

            The Solaris file you will receive is called <i>bs-solaris-i386.tar.gz</i>.  Once
            downloaded, create a folder in which you wish to have BeServed installed, as in:<br>
            <pre>mkdir /usr/local/BeServed</pre>
            Then, move the installation file into that folder and change the current working folder

            Now, uncompress the installation files using the gunzip command.<br>
            <pre>gunzip bs-solaris-i386.tar.gz</pre>
            You should now have a file without the .gz extension, ending in .tar.  You can use the
            Solaris tar command to expand this archive.  This is done using the -x tar option.<br>
            <pre>tar -xf bs-solaris-i386.tar</pre>

            BeServed should now be installed as a default daemon on your Solaris system, it should
            be running, and will be started each time the system is booted.  You can now delete the
            tar file that still remains.<br>
            <pre>rm -f bs-solaris-i386.tar</pre>

            The compressed file you will receive is called <i>bs-win32-nt-i386.zip</i>.  Once
            downloaded, you will need to uncompress it into a temporary folder with WinZip or
            another PKZIP-compatible extraction utility.  From the temporary folder, simply run
            <i>setup.exe</i> to perform the installation.  The server can be started from the
            Start menu.  The File Sharing preferences application is also available from the
            Start menu and allows you to specify the folders that will be shared with other
            users without manually editing the settings file.<br><br>
            Once installed, you do not need to retain the original compressed file you downloaded.
