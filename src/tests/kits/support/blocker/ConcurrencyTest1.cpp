 *           iterates MAXLOOP times through the main loop where the following

 *              - CheckLock() is used to show that the thread does not have
 *                the lock.
 *              - The thread acquires the lock.
 *              - The thread confirms that mutual exclusion is OK by testing
 *                lockTestValue.
 *              - The thread confirms the lock is held once by the thread.
 *              - The thread acquires the lock again.
 *              - The thread confirms the lock is held twice now by the thread.
 *              - The thread releases the lock once.
 *              - The thread confirms the lock is held once now.
 *              - The thread confirms that mutual exclusion is still OK by
 *                testing lockTestValue.
 *              - The thread releases the lock again.
 *              - The thread confirms that the lock is no longer held.
