	This file implements a test class for testing BLocker functionality.
	It tests use cases "Count Lock Requests" for a semaphore style BLocker.
	
	The test works by:
		- checking the lock requests
		- acquiring the lock
		- checking the lock requests
		- staring a thread which times out acquiring the lock and then blocks
		  again waiting for the lock
		- checking the lock requests
		- start a second thread which times out acquiring the lock and then blocks
		  again waiting for the lock
		- checking the lock requests
		- release the lock
		- each blocked thread acquires the lock, checks the lock requests and releases
		  the lock before terminating
		- the main thread checks the lock requests one last time
