This is NETPERF 2.2pl4 from www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html, ported
to work with the yet-to-be named OpenBeOS project.

Cheers,

P.S.: My apologies to those on the open-beos-cvs list for the copious amount
      of auto-generated e-mails.  For some bizarre reason I cannot do a bulk
      CVS commit from home, puts my system to sleep.  *STM  2004.01.31*
