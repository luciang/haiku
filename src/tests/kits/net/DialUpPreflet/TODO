Short-term TODOs:
- add "Revert Changes" button
- IPCP: check for incorrect settings (only IP addresses should be entered)
- PPPoE: refresh interfaces list every second or so
- ConnectionOptions: add field for entering number of connect retries and delay between retries

Mid-term TODOs:
- load add-ons from /boot/home/config/add-ons/ptp

Long-term TODOs:
- (maybe) allow selecting multiple authenticators (in expert-mode)
- move DEVNOTES into a doxygen file and document the rest of the API
