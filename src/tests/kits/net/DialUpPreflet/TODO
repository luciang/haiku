Short-term TODOs:
- add "Extras" tab for changing dial-behaviour (auto-redial, dial-on-demand, etc.)
- add "Revert Changes" button
- load add-ons
- move DEVNOTES into a doxygen file and document the rest of the API
- IPCP: check for incorrect settings (only IP addresses should be entered)

Long-term TODOs:
- (maybe) allow selecting multiple authenticators (in expert-mode)
