The /current/src/tests directories are supposed to contain unit tests
(CppUnit or otherwise) and not tryout programs (no matter how useful)
That's why in due time we will remove the following items from this folder:

 - midi_player and midi_player_replacement. The Midi Player is now the
   responsibility of the prefs/apps team, not of the Midi Team.

 - synth_file_reader. It doesn't make much sense for us to reverse
   engineer the format of the soundbanks from the R5 softsynth, because
   we are not allowed to redistribute these banks anyway.

This README is just a reminder so we don't forget to clean this up someday.
