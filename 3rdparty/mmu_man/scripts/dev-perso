# project-specific environment handling:
# - sources project-specific .profile,
# - maintains project-specific .bash_history with bigger default size,
# to avoid mixing command histories
# - pushes "cvs up -d" or "svn up" or "p4 sync" as last history command
# for quick access
# - has a nice prompt
# - lowers shell priority on BeOS to limit the effects of svn or jam on
# the gui
# - automatically completes project names on the "dev" function
# from project subfolders containing a .profile
#
# This script should be sourced by bash, either from /etc/profile
# (in /etc/profile.d/) or your own .bashrc or .profile
# 
# setup:
# - edit DRLIST below to include your own possible devroots
# (ie. where you have subfolders for your own projects)
# - optionally edit PWLIST below to where you possibly have a
# PASSWDS/ folder with passwords stored as plain text.
# (not really a good idea though :) It's exported
# for use by project's .profile
# - optionally force EDITOR globally (for all projects)
# - for each project create a .profile in the subfolder,
# which might include commands like the following, but can remain empty.
# usually it will just contain a "cd" to the source/trunk subfolder...
#
#	# force svn ssh user for this project
#	export SVN_SSH='ssh -l myuser'
#
#	# force CVSROOT for this project
#	export CVSROOT='...'
#
#	# shortcut to display password file for this svn
#	alias pass="cat $PASSWDS/myself.developer.berlios.de.pass"
#
#	# change to the source tree
#	cd trunk
#	# ease use of cd
#	export CDPATH=":$PWD"
#
# Now you just have to type:
# dev h[TAB]
# to complete to "dev haiku", [RET] and you'll get the history from the
# last time you worked on it, and everything set up.


# automagically find them on different machines...
