<p>PoorMan is a nice little webserver that's extremly easy to set up. Naturally it doesn't offer any advanced features like other heavy duty server software, it's after all only a poor man's webserver.</p>
<p>Upon its first launch, PoorMan asks for the folder that is about to be served to the web. If you go with the <span class="button">Default</span>, a new folder <span class="path">/boot/home/public_html</span> is created for you. As a start page a HTML file named by default <span class="cli">index.html</span> has to be present there.</p>
<p>PoorMan presents itself with a simple console that logs its activity, information if the server is running and which directory is being served, a hit counter and a menubar to access e.g. the settings:</p>
<p><img id="poorman" src="../images/apps-images/poorman.png" alt="poorman.png" /></p>
<p>The settings panel is divided into three tabs:</p>
<p>In <span class="menu">Site</span> you can select another folder to serve, enter another start page and have the option to send a file listing if the start page isn't present.<br />
<span class="menu">Logging</span> lets you de/activate logging to the console or optionally to a separate logfile.<br />
The <span class="menu">Advanced</span> tab holds the setting for the maximum simultaneous connections.</p>
<p>The menu items of the console window are all self-explanatory. With them you can e.g. save (parts) of the console output, clear the console or logging file and start/stop the server or clear the hit counter.</p>

<div class="box-info">If you want to try out if PoorMan's working, choose <span class="path">/boot/apps/BePDF/docs/</span> as folder and <span class="cli">index.html</span> as start page. Then point your browser to the URL 127.0.0.1, which is your local host.</div>
