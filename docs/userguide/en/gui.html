<div class="title">Haiku's GUI</div>

<p>Haiku's graphical user interface is an integral part of the system. Unlike Unix-based operating systems, there's no separate window manager and booting just into a command line shell is not possible. Haiku's focus being on the desktop user, this is just not considered necessary.</p>
<p>As you probably have experience with other graphical environments, let's skip over the standards like menus, right-click context menus, drag&amp;drop etc. Let's have a look at the few unique aspects of Haiku's GUI instead.</p>
<img src="images/gui-images/gui.png" alt="gui.png" />
<p>There are only a few things in Haiku's GUI that aren't obvious and deserve an explanation.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Deskbar is Haiku's "Start" menu and taskbar, if you will. See topic <a href="deskbar.html">Deskbar</a>.</p></li>
<li>The yellow tab offers more than just a program's name or a document's filename:
<ul><li>You can move it by holding the <span class="key">SHIFT</span> key while dragging it to another position, enabling you to stack a number of windows and conveniently access them by their named tab.</li>
<li>You minimize a window with a double-click on its tab (or with <span class="key">CTRL</span>&#160;<span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">M</span>). A such hidden window can be accessed by its entry in the <a href="deskbar.html">Deskbar</a> or the <a href="twitcher.html">Twitcher</a>.</li>
<li>You can send a window to the back with a right-click on its tab (or its border).</li></ul></li>
<li><p>The close button.</p></li>
<li><p>The "alternative size" button (or <span class="key">CTRL</span>&#160;<span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">Z</span>). In most applications, this will expand a window to maximum size. It doesn't have to, however. Tracker windows, for example, will resize to best fit the contents.</p></li>
<li><p>The resize corner. Dragging anywhere else on a window's border will move the window.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="box-info">While holding <span class="key">CTRL</span>&#160;<span class="key">ALT</span>, you can click anywhere into a window to move it with the left mouse button; the right mouse button sends it to the back.</div>

<h1>
<a href="#logo"><img src="../images/up.png" align="right" alt="index" border="0" class="noprint" /></a>
<a id="open-save-panel" name="open-save-panel">Open and save panels</a></h1>
<p>When opening or saving a file from any application, a panel like this opens:</p>
<img src="images/gui-images/open-save.png" alt="open-save.png" />
<p>It has all the usual things: A list of files of the current folder to choose from, in case of a save panel, a text field to enter a filename and a drop-down menu for different file formats and their settings.<br />
You can enter parent folders with the drop-down menu above the file listing.</p>
<p>If you already have a Tracker window with the location for a file open, you can simply drag either any file or the folder-representation (i.e. the symbol to the far right in its menu bar) into the panel. This changes the panel to that new location.</p>

<h2>
<a href="#logo"><img src="../images/up.png" align="right" alt="index" border="0" class="noprint" /></a>
<a id="open-save-shortcuts" name="open-save-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</a></h2>
<p>You can use many of the shortcuts also used in Tracker. Besides the commands that are also available through the <span class="menu">File</span> menu, there are a few not that obvious:</p>
<table summary="shortcuts" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">N</span></td><td></td><td> Creates a new folder.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">E</span></td><td></td><td> Lets you rename the selected entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">&uarr;</span></td><td style="width:24px;"></td><td> Opens the parent folder.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="onelinetop"><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">&darr;</span> or <span class="key">ENTER</span></td><td></td><td> Opens the selected folder.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">D</span></td><td></td><td> Takes you to your Desktop.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">H</span></td><td></td><td> Takes you to your Home folder.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>
<a href="#logo"><img src="../images/up.png" align="right" alt="index" border="0" class="noprint" /></a>
<a id="favorites-recent" name="favorites-recent">Favorites and recent folders</a></h2>
<p>The menu <span class="menu">Favorites</span> provides recently visited folders and favorite locations that you can set up yourself. As indicated by the little arrow, you can also use these locations to navigate further down the hierarchy via submenus.</p>
<img src="images/gui-images/favorites.png" alt="favorites.png" />
<p>To add a Favorite, you simply navigate to your destination and choose <span class="menu">Favorites | Add Current Folder</span>. From now on it will appear in every open/save panel. To remove a Favorite, choose <span class="menu">Favorites | Configure Favorites...</span> and delete its entry.<br />
All Favorites are kept in <span class="path">/boot/home/config/settings/Tracker/Go/</span>. So you might as well add and remove links to files and folders there directly.</p>
