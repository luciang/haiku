<p>The Appearance preferences lets you change some aspects of Haiku's visuals.
</p>

<h2><a name="colors">Colors</a></h2>

<br>
<p>In the first tab, <i>Colors</i>, you can change the colors of different parts of the user interface. The color well accepts drag&drops from other programs, letting you drag colors over from e.g. <i>WonderBrush</i>, <i>Icon-O-Matic</i> or the <i>Backgrounds</i> panel.
</p>

<h2><a name="antialiasing">Antialiasing</a></h2>
<img src="prefs-images/appearance-antialiasing.png" alt="appearance-antialiasing.png" width="460" height="337">
<br>
<p>The second tab, <i>Antialiasing</i>, provides different settings for how things are rendered on screen.<br>
An activated <i>Glyph hinting</i> aligns all letters in such a way that their vertical and horizontal edges rest exactly between two pixels. The result is a perfect contrast, especially when dealing with black on white. Text appears crisper.
</p><p>See the difference of the two settings with these magnified screenshots:
</p>
<img src="prefs-images/appearance-glyph-off.png" alt="appearance-glyph-off.png" width="296" height="207">&nbsp;<img src="prefs-images/appearance-glyph-on.png" alt="appearance-glyph-on.png" width="296" height="207">
<br>
<p>Another technique to improve rendering is <i>Antialiasing</i>, which supports all vector graphics as well as text. It smoothes lines by changing the color of certain pixels. There are two methods for that:</p>
<p><i>Greyscale</i> changes the intensity of pixels at the edge.</br>
<i>LCD subpixel</i> does an even better job, especially with (high resolution) LCD monitors. Instead of the intensity of a pixel, it changes its color which moves an edge by a fraction of a pixel, because LCD displays produce every pixel with a red, green and blue component.
</p><p>Again, the two different methods with magnified screenshots:
</p>
<img src="prefs-images/appearance-glyph-off.png" alt="appearance-glyph-off.png" width="296" height="207">&nbsp;<img src="prefs-images/appearance-subpixel.png" alt="appearance-subpixel.png" width="296" height="207">
<br>
<p>Subpixel based antialiasing adds a slight colored shine to objects. Something not everyone tolerates. In Haiku you can mix the two antialiasing methods and find the right setting for you by using a slider.
</p><p><b>Note: </b>The subpixel based antialiasing in combination with the glyph hinting is subject of a software patent and is therefore not available by default. Depending on where in the world you live, you may get an unlocked version. Sorry about that. Talk with your representative.
