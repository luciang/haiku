<H1>Resources for the Be File System</H1>

<p>Probably the best resource for a description of the inner workings of BFS is the
book "Practical File System Design with the Be File System" written by Dominic
Giampaolo and published by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. Although that book is out of
print, it's available as a free download from
<A HREF="http://www.letterp.com/~dbg/">Dominic's web site</A>.

<p>If you prefer to see how it works in code, please have a look at Haiku's BFS
implementation - you can find that in the SVN repository under
src/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/bfs/. This code is not mature yet, but is considered
to be fairly stable.

<p>If you are interested in the Haiku file system API, please refer to its documentation
as part of the Haiku book.
