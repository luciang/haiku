<H1>Testing the Midi Kit</H1>

<P>Most of the OpenBeOS source code has unit tests in the current/src/tests 
directory. I looked into building CppUnit tests for the midi2 kit, but decided 
that it doesn't really make much sense. Unit tests work best if you can test 
something in isolation, but in the case of the midi2 kit this is very hard to 
achieve. Because the classes from libmidi2.so always need to talk to the 
midi_server, the tests depend on too many external factors. The available 
endpoints, for example, will differ from system to system. The spray and hook 
functions are difficult to test this way, too.</P>

<P>So instead of a CppUnit test suite, here is a list of manual tests that I 
performed when developing the midi2 kit:</P>

<HR SIZE="1">

<H2>Registering the application</H2>

<P><I>Required:</I> Client app that calls BMidiRoster::MidiRoster()</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>When a client app starts, it should first receive mNEW notifications for 
all endpoints in the system (even unregistered remotes), followed by mCON 
notifications for all connections in the system (even those between two 
unregistered local endpoints from another app).</P></LI>

<LI><P>Send invalid Mapp message (without messenger). The midi_server ignores 
the request, and the client app blocks forever.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Fake a delivery error for the mNEW notifications and the mAPP reply. 
(Add a snooze() in the midi_server's OnRegisterApplication(). While it is 
snoozing, Ctrl-C the client app. Now the server can't deliver the message and 
will unregister the application again.)</P></LI>

<LI><P>Kill the server. Start the client app. It should realize that the server 
is not running, and return from MidiRoster(); it does not block 
forever.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Note: The server does not protect against sending two or more Mapp 
messages; it will add a new app_t object to the roster and it will also send 
out the mNEW and mCON notifications again.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Verify that when the client app quits, the BMidiRoster instance is 
destroyed by the BMidiRosterKiller. The BMidiRosterLooper is also destroyed, 
along with any endpoint objects from its list. We don't destroy endpoints with 
a refcount > 0, but print a warning message on stderr instead.</P></LI>

<LI><P>When the app quits before it has created a BMidiRoster instance, the 
BMidiRosterKiller should do nothing.</P></LI>

</UL>

<HR SIZE="1">

<H2>Creating endpoints</H2>

<P><I>Required:</I> Client app that creates a new BMidiLocalProducer and/or 
BMidiLocalConsumer</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>Send invalid Mnew message (missing fields). The server will return an 
error code.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Don't send reply from midi_server. The client receives a B_NO_REPLY 
error.</P></LI>

<LI><P>If something goes wrong creating a new local endpoint, you still get a 
new BMidiEndpoint object (but it is not added to BMidiRosterLooper's internal 
list of endpoints). Verify that its ID() function returns 0, and IsValid() 
returns false. Verify that you can Release() it without crashing into the 
debugger (i.e. the reference count of the new object should be 1).</P></LI>

<LI><P>Snooze in midi_server's OnCreateEndpoint() before sending reply to 
client to simulate heavy processor load. Client should timeout. When done 
snoozing, server fails to deliver the reply because the client is no longer 
listening, and it unregisters the app.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Note: if you kill the client app with Ctrl-C before the server has sent 
its reply, SendReply() still returns okay, and the midi_server adds the 
endpoint, even though the corresponding app is dead. There is not much we can 
do to prevent that (but it is not really a big deal).</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start the test app from two different Terminals. Verify that the new 
local endpoint of app1 is added to the BMidiRosterLooper's list of endpoints, 
and that its "isLocal" flag is true. Verify that when you start the second app, 
it immediately receives mNEW notifications for the first app's endpoints. It 
should also create BMidiEndpoint proxy objects for these endpoints with 
"isLocal" set to false, and add them its own list. Vice versa for the endpoints 
that app2 creates. Verify that the "registered" field in the mNEW notification 
is false, because newly created endpoints are not registered yet. The 
"properties" field should contain an empty message.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start server. Start client app. The app makes new endpoints and the 
server adds them to the roster. Ctrl-C the app. Start client app again. The new 
client first receives mNEW notifications for the old app's endpoints. When the 
new app tries to create its own endpoints, the server realizes that the old app 
is dead, and sends mDEL notifications for the now-defunct endpoints.</P></LI>

<LI><P>The test app should now create 2 endpoints. Let the midi_server snooze 
during the second create message, so the app times out. The server now 
unregisters the app and purges its first endpoint (which was successfully 
created).</P></LI>

<LI><P>The test app should now create 3 endpoints. Let the midi_server snooze 
during the second create message, so the app times out. (It also times out when 
sending the create request for the 3rd endpoint, because the server is still 
snoozing.) Because it cannot send a reply for the 2nd create message, the 
server now unregisters the app and purges its first endpoint (which was 
successfully created). Then it processes the create request for the 3rd 
endpoint, but ignores it because the app is now no longer registered with the 
server.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Purging endpoints. The test app should now create 2 endpoints. Let the 
midi_server snooze during the _fourth_ create message. Run the server. Run the 
test app. Run the test app again in a second Terminal. The server times out, 
and unregisters the second app. The first app should receive an mDEL 
notification. Repeat, but now the test app should make 3 endpoints and the 
server fails on the _sixth_ endpoint. The first app now receives 2 mDEL 
notifications.</P></LI>

<LI><P>You should be allowed to pass NULL into the BMidiLocalProducer and 
BMidiLocalConsumer constructor.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Let the midi_server assign random IDs to new endpoints; the 
BMidiRosterLooper should sort the endpoints by their IDs when it adds them to 
its internal list.</P></LI>

</UL>

<HR SIZE="1">

<H2>Deleting endpoints</H2>

<P><I>Required:</I> client app that creates one or more endpoints and 
Release()'s them</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>Verify that Acquire() increments the endpoint's refcount and Release() 
decrements it. When you Release() a local endpoint so its refcount becomes 
zero, the client sends an Mdel request to the server. When you Release() a 
local endpoint too many times, your app jumps into the debugger.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Send an Mdel request with an invalid ID to the server. Examples of 
invalid IDs: -1, 0, 1000 (or any other large number).</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start the test app from two different Terminals. Note that when one of 
the apps Release()'s its endpoints, the other receives corresponding mDEL 
notifications.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Snooze in midi_server's OnCreateEndpoint() before sending reply to 
"create endpoint" request. The client will timeout and the server will 
unregister the app. Now have the client Release() the endpoint. This sends a 
"delete endpoint" request to the server, which ignores the request because the 
app is no longer registered.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Override BMidiLocalProducer and BMidiLocalConsumer, and provide a public 
destructor. Call "delete prod; delete cons;" from your code, instead of using 
Release(). Your app should drop into the debugger.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start the client app and let it make its endpoints. Kill the server. 
Release() the endpoints. The server doesn't run, so the Mdel request never 
arrives, but the BMidiEndpoint objects should be deleted regardless.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start the test app from two different Terminals, and let them make their 
endpoints. Quit the apps (using the Deskbar's "Quit Application" menu item). 
Verify that both clean up and exit correctly. App1 removes its own endpoint 
from the BMidiRosterLooper's list of endpoints and sends an 'mDEL' message to 
the server, which passes it on to app2. In response, app2 removes the proxy 
object from its own list and deletes it. Again, vice versa for the endpoint 
from app2.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start both apps again and wait until they have notified each other about 
the endpoints. Ctrl-C app1, and restart it. Verify that app1 receives the 
'mNEW' messages and creates proxies for these remote endpoints. Both apps 
should receive an 'mDEL' message for app1's old endpoint (because the 
midi_server realizes it no longer exists and purges it), and remove it from 
their lists accordingly.</P></LI>

</UL>

<HR SIZE="1">

<H2>Changing attributes</H2>

<P><I>Required:</I> Client app that creates an endpoint and calls Register(), 
Unregister(), SetName(), and SetLatency()</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>Send an Mchg request with an invalid ID to the server.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Register() a local endpoint that is already registered. This does not 
send a message to the server and always returns B_OK. Likewise for 
Unregister()ing a local endpoint that is not registered.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Register() or Unregister() a remote endpoint, or an invalid local 
endpoint. That should immediately return an error code.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Verify that BMidiRoster::Register() does the same thing as 
BMidiEndpoint::Register(). Also for BMidiRoster::Unregister() and 
BMidiEndpoint::Unregister().</P></LI>

<LI><P>If you pass NULL into BMidiRoster::Register() or Unregister(), the 
functions immediately return with an error code.</P></LI>

<LI><P>SetName() should ignore NULL names. When you call it on a remote 
endpoint, SetName() should do nothing. SetName() does not send a message if the 
new name is the same as the current name.</P></LI>

<LI><P>SetLatency() should ignore negative values. SetLatency() does not send a 
message if the new latency is the same as the current latency. (Since 
SetLatency() lives in BMidiLocalConsumer, you can never use it on remote 
endpoints.)</P></LI>

<LI><P>Kill the server after making the new endpoint, and call Register(). The 
client app should return an error code. Also for Unregister(),  SetName(), 
SetLatency(), and SetProperties().</P></LI>

<LI><P>Snooze in the midi_server's OnChangeEndpoint() before sending the reply 
to the client. Both sides will flag an error. No mCHG notifications will be 
sent. The server unregisters the app and purges its endpoints.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Verify that other apps will receive mCHG notifications when the test app 
successfully calls Register(), Unregister(), SetName(), and SetLatency(), and 
that they modify the corresponding BMidiEndpoint objects accordingly. Since 
clients are never notified when they change their own endpoints, they should 
ignore the notifications that concern local endpoints. Latency changes should 
be ignored if the endpoint is not a consumer.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Send an Mchg request with only the "midi:id" field, so no "midi:name", 
"midi:registered", "midi:latency", or "midi:properties". The server will still 
notify the other apps, although they will obviously ignore the notification, 
because it doesn't contain any useful data.</P></LI>

<LI><P>The Mchg request is overloaded to change several attributes. Verify that 
changing one of these attributes, such as the latency, does not overwrite/wipe 
out the others.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start app1. Wait until it has created and registered its endpoint. Start 
app2. During the initial handshake, app2 should receive an 'mNEW' message for 
app1's endpoint. Verify that the "refistered" field in this message is already 
true, and that this is passed on correctly to the new BMidiEndpoint proxy 
object.</P></LI>

<LI><P>GetProperties() should return NULL if the message parameter is 
NULL.</P></LI>

<LI><P>The properties of new endpoints are empty. Create a new endpoint and 
call GetProperties(). The BMessage that you receive should contain no 
fields.</P></LI>

<LI><P>SetProperties() should return NULL if the message parameter is NULL. It 
should return an error code if the endpoint is remote or invalid. It should 
work fine on local endpoints, registered or not. SetProperties() does not 
compare the contents of the new BMessage to the old, so it will always send out 
the change request.</P></LI>

<LI><P>If you Unregister() an endpoint that is connected, the connection should 
not be broken.</P></LI>

</UL>

<HR SIZE="1">

<H2>Consulting the roster</H2>

<P><I>Required:</I> Client app that creates several endpoints, and registers 
some of them (not all), and uses the BMidiRoster::FindEndpoint() etc functions 
to examine the roster.</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>Verify that FindEndpoint() returns NULL if you pass it:</P>

<UL>
<LI>invalid ID (localOnly = false)</LI>
<LI>invalid ID (localOnly = true)</LI>
<LI>remote non-registered endpoint (localOnly = false)</LI>
<LI>remote non-registered endpoint (localOnly = true)</LI>
<LI>remote registered endpoint (localOnly = true)</LI>
</UL><BR>

<P>Verify that FindEndpoint() returns a valid BMidiEndpoint object if you pass 
it:</P>

<UL>
<LI>local non-registered endpoint (localOnly = false)</LI>
<LI>local non-registered endpoint (localOnly = true)</LI>
<LI>local registered endpoint (localOnly = false)</LI>
<LI>local registered endpoint (localOnly = true)</LI>
<LI>remote registered endpoint (localOnly = false)</LI>
</UL><BR>
 
</LI>

<LI><P>Verify that FindConsumer() works just like FindEndpoint(), but that it 
also returns NULL if the endpoint with the specified ID is not a consumer. 
Likewise for FindProducer().</P></LI>

<LI><P>Verify that NextEndpoint() returns NULL if you pass it NULL. It also 
returns NULL if no more endpoints exist. Otherwise, it returns a BMidiEndpoint 
object, bumps the endpoint's reference count, and sets the "id" parameter to 
the ID of the endpoint. NextEndpoint() should never return local endpoints 
(registered or not), nor unregistered remote endpoints. Verify that negative 
"id" values also work.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Verify that you can safely call the Find and Next functions without 
having somehow initialized the BMidiRoster first (by making a new endpoint, for 
example). The functions themselves should call MidiRoster() and do the 
handshake with the server.</P></LI>

<LI><P>The Find and Next functions should bump the reference count of the 
BMidiEndpoint object that they return. However, they should not (inadvertently) 
modify the refcounts of any other endpoint objects.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Get a BMidiEndpoint proxy for a remote published endpoint. Release(). 
Now it should not be removed from the endpoint list or even be deleted, even 
though its reference count dropped to zero.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start app1. Start app2. App2 gets a BMidiEndpoint proxy for a remote 
endpoint from app1. Ctrl-C app1. Start app1 again. Now app2 receives an mDEL 
message for app1's old endpoint. Verify that the endpoint is removed from the 
endpoint list, but not deleted because its reference count isn't zero. If app2 
now Release()s the endpoint, the BMidiEndpoint object should be deleted. Try 
again, but now Release() the endpoint before you Ctrl-C; now it should be 
deleted and removed from the list when you start app1 again.</P></LI>

</UL>

<HR SIZE="1">

<H2>Making/breaking connections</H2>

<P><I>Required:</I> Client app that creates a producer and consumer endpoint, 
optionally registers them, consults the roster for remote endpoints, and makes 
various kinds of connections.</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>Test the following for BMidiProducer::Connect():</P>

<UL>
<LI>Connect(NULL)</LI>
<LI>Connect(invalid consumer)</LI>
<LI>Connect() using an invalid producer</LI>

2 remote endpoints. Test the local endpoints both registered and 
unregistered.</LI>
<LI>2x Connect() on same consumer should give an error</LI>
<LI>The other applications should receive an mCON notification, and adjust 
their own local rosters accordingly</LI>
<LI>If you are calling Connect() on a local producer, its Connected() hook 
should be called. If you are calling Connect() on a remote producer, then its

<LI><P>Make a connection on a local producer. Release() the producer. The other 
app should only receive an mDEL notification. Likewise if you have a connection 
with a local consumer and you Release() that. However, now all apps should 
throw away this consumer from the connection lists, invoking the Disconnected() 
hook of local producers. The same thing happens if you Ctrl-C the app and 
restart it. (Now the old endpoints are purged.)</P></LI>

<LI><P>BMidiProducer::IsConnected() should return false if you pass NULL or an

<HR SIZE="1">

<H2>Watching</H2>

<P><I>Required:</I> Client app that creates local consumer and producer 
endpoints, and calls Register(), Unregister(), SetName(), SetLatency(), and 
SetProperties(). It should also make and break connections.</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>When you call StartWatching(), you should receive B_MIDI_EVENT 
notifications for all remote registered endpoints and the connections between 
them. You will get no notifications for local endpoints, or for any connections 
that involve unregistered endpoints. The BMidiRosterLooper should make a copy 
of the BMessenger, so when the client destroys the original messenger, you will 
still receive notifications. Verify that calling StartWatching() with the same 
BMessenger twice in a row will also send the initial set of notifications 
twice. StartWatching(NULL) should be ignored and does not remove the current 
messenger.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Run the client app from two different Terminals. Verify that you receive 
properly formatted B_MIDI_EVENT notifications when the other app changes the 
attributes of its <I>registered</I> endpoints with the various Set() functions. 
You should also receive notifications if the app Register()s or Unregister()s 
its endpoints. That app that makes these changes does not receive the 
notifications.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Run the client app from two different Terminals. Verify that you receive 
properly formatted B_MIDI_EVENT notifications when the apps make and break 
connections. Every app receives these connection notifications, whether the 
endpoints are published or not. The app that makes and breaks the connections 
does not receive any notifications.</P></LI>

<LI><P>StopWatching() should delete BMidiRosterLooper's BMessenger copy, if 
any. Verify that you no longer receive B_MIDI_EVENT notifications for remote 
endpoints after you have called StopWatching().</P></LI>

<LI><P>If the client is watching, and the BMidiRosterLooper receives an mDEL 
notification for a registered remote endpoint, it should also send an 
"unregistered" B_MIDI_EVENT to let the client know that this endpoint is no 
longer available. If the endpoint was connected to anything, you'll also 
receive "disconnected" B_MIDI_EVENTs.</P></LI>

<LI><P>If you get a "registered" event, and you do FindEndpoint() for that id, 
you'll get its BMidiEndpoint object. If you get an "unregistered" event, then 
FindEndpoint() returns NULL. So the events are send <I>after</I> the roster is 
modified.</P></LI>

</UL>

<HR SIZE="1">

<H2>Event tests</H2>

<P><I>Required:</I> Several client apps that create and register consumer 
endpoints that override the various MIDI event hook functions, as well as 
producer endpoints that spray MIDI events. Also useful is a tool that lets you 
make connections between all these endpoints (PatchBay), and a tool that lets 
you monitor the MIDI events (MidiMonitor).</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>BMidiLocalProducer's spray functions should only try to send something 
if there is one or more connected consumer. If the spray functions cannot 
deliver their events, they simply ignore that consumer until the next spray. 
(No connections are broken or anything.)</P></LI>

<LI><P>All spray functions except SprayData() should set the atomic flag to 
true, even SpraySystemExclusive().</P></LI>

<LI><P>When you send a sysex message using SpraySystemExclusive(), it should 
add 0xF0 in front of your data and 0xF7 at the back. When you call SprayData() 
instead, no bytes are added to the MIDI event data.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Verify that all events arrive correctly and that the latency is minimal, 
even when the load is heavy (i.e. many events are being sprayed to many 
different consumers).</P></LI>

<LI><P>Verify that the BMidiLocalConsumer destructor properly destroys the 
corresponding port and event thread before it returns.</P></LI>

<LI><P>BMidiLocalConsumer should ignore messages that are too small, addressed 
to another consumer, or otherwise invalid.</P></LI>

<LI><P>BMidiLocalConsumer's Data() hook should ignore all non-atomic events. 
The rest of the events, provided they contain the correct number of bytes for 
that kind of event, are passed on to the other hooks.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Hook a producer up to a consumer and call all SprayXXX() functions with

<LI><P>Call GetProducerID() from one of BMidiLocalConsumer's hooks to verify 
that this indeed returns the ID of the producer that sprayed the 
event.</P></LI>

<LI><P>To test timeouts, first call SetTimeout(system_time() + 2000000), spray 
an event to the consumer, and wait 2 seconds. The consumer's Timeout() hook 
should now be called. Try again, but now spray multiple events to the consumer. 
The Timeout() hook should still be called after 2 seconds, measured from the 
moment the timeout was set. Replace the call to SetTimeout() with 
SetTimeout(0). After spraying the first event, you should immediately get the 
Timeout() signal, because the target time was set in the past. Verify that 
calling SetTimeout() only takes effect after at least one new event has been 
received.</P></LI>

<H2>Other tests</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>Kill the server. Now run a client app. It should recognize that the 
server isn't running, and return error codes on all operations. Also kill the 
server while the test app is running. From then on, the client app will return 
error codes on all operations. Also bring it back up again while the test app 
is still running. Now the client app's request messages will be delivered to 
the server again, but the server will ignore them, because our app did not 
register with this new instance of the server.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Start the midi_server and several client apps. Use PatchBay to make and 
break a whole bunch of connections. Quit PatchBay. Start it again. Now the same 
connections should show up. Run similar tests with MidiKeyboard. Also install 
VirtualMidi (and run the old midi_server for the time being) to get a whole 
bunch of fake MIDI devices.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Regression bug:</I> After you quit one client app, another app fails 
to send request to the midi_server.</P>

<P><I>Required:</I> Client app that creates a new endpoint and registers it. In 
the app's destructor, it unregisters and releases the endpoint.</P>

<P><I>How to reproduce:</I> Run the app from two different Terminals. Ctrl-C 
app1. Start app1 again. From the Deskbar quit both apps at the same time (that 
is possible because app1 and app2 both have the same signature). When it tries 
to send the Unregister() request to the midi_server, app2 gives the error 
"Cannot send msg to server". The error code is "Bad Port ID", which means that 
the reply port is dead. The Mdel message from Release() is sent without any 
problems, however, because that expects no reply back. This is not the only way 
to reproduce the problem, but it seems to be the most reliable one.</P>

<P>The reason this happens is because you kill app1. When app2 sends a 
synchronous request to the midi_server, the server re-used that same message to 
notify the other apps. (Because it already contained all the necessary fields.) 
But app1 is dead, the notification fails, and this (probably) wipes out the 
reply address in the message. I changed the midi_server to create new BMessages 
for the notifications, and was no longer able to reproduce the 
problem.</P></LI>
