<A NAME="interface"></A><H2>BPropertyInfo Interface:</H2>

<P>The BPropertyInfo class is a simple class for describing the scripting interface which a 
BHandler provides.  It makes implementing the ResolveSpecifier() hook function easier to implement.
One source of information for the BPropertyInfo interface can be found
<A HREF="file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/The%20Application%20Kit/PropertyInfo.html">here in the Be Book</A>.
Unfortunately, details of some changes to this interface introduced in BeOS 4 does not seem to have
made it into the BeBook.  For the latest, refer to the
<A HREF="file:///boot/develop/headers/be/app/PropertyInfo.h">PropertyInfo.h</A> header file or the
<A HREF="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/bug/Be%20Book/Release_Notes/R4RN_AppKit.html">BeOS 4 Developer Release Notes</A>.

<A NAME="usecases"></A><H2>BPropertyInfo Use Cases:</H2>

<P>The following use cases cover the BPropertyInfo functionality:</P>

<OL>

<LI><P><B>Construction 1:</B> A BPropertyInfo can be created with 0 arguments.  In this case,
it will not have any property_info or value_info structures associated with it.  The only
way to initialize it would be to Unflatten() a flattened BPropertyInfo instance (see Unflatten
use cases).</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Construction 2:</B> A BPropertyInfo can be created with a single property_info argument.
In this case, there will be no value_info structure associated with it and the BPropertyInfo
will assume it does not need to de-allocate the property_info structure itself on 
destruction.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Construction 3:</B> A BPropertyInfo can be created with a property_info argument and
a value_info argument.  In this case, the BPropertyInfo will use both of these arguments to
determine its future behaviour.  It will assume it does not need to de-allocate the property_info
structure or the value_info structure itself on destruction.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Construction 4:</B> A BPropertyInfo can be created with a property_info argument and
a value_info argument and a flag to indicate whether these structres were allocated on the heap.
If the flag is false, it will assume it does not need to de-allocate the property_info structure
or the value_info structure itself on destruction.  If the flag is true, it will assume that
the property_info pointer and the value_info pointer and all pointers contained within them (ie
const char * instances) need to be free()'d when the BPropertyInfo is destructed.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Destruction:</B> On destruction, a BPropertyInfo class does nothing unless the third
argument (free_on_delete flag) at construction was true.  If this argument was true, the 
BPropertyInfo class performs a "free()" on the pointers passed in at construction time and all
pointers contained within these structures.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Properties:</B> The Properties() member function returns the first argument passed in
at construction time of the BPropertyInfo or NULL if it was constructed with no arguments.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Values:</B> The Values() member function returns the second argument passed in
at construction time of the BPropertyInfo or NULL if it was constructed with one or fewer 
arguments.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Count Properties:</B> The CountProperties() member function returns the number of
elements in the NULL terminated array of property_info structures passed in as the first argument
at construction time.  If the BPropertyInfo class was constructed with no arguments, 0 is 
returned.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Count Values:</B> The CountValues() member function returns the number of
elements in the NULL terminated array of value_info structures passed in as the second argument
at construction time.  If the BPropertyInfo class was constructed with one or fewer arguments, 0 is 
returned.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Fixed Size:</B> The IsFixedSize() method always returns false indicating that a
BPropertyInfo class instance can be flattened but the size of that flattened instance depends on
the state of the BPropertyInfo class itself.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Type Code:</B> The TypeCode() method always returns B_PROPERTY_INFO_TYPE ('SCTD') 
regardless of the state of the BPropertyInfo class instance indicating that the flattened instance
is of type B_PROPERTY_INFO_TYPE.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Allows Type Code:</B> The AllowsTypeCode() method returns false for all passed in type
codes unless B_PROPERTY_INFO_TYPE ('SCTD') is passed in when this method returns true.  This 
implies that a BPropertyInfo class instance can be unflattened from flattened data of 
B_PROPERTY_INFO_TYPE only (NOTE: the Be implementation seems to return true for all values
passed in although that doesn't seem to make much sense).</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Flattened Size:</B> The FlattenedSize() member function retures the number of bytes
required to store a flattened version of the BPropertyInfo instance.  The size will be determined
by the description of the flattened data structure described in the "implementation" section
below.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Flatten:</B> The Flatten() member function turns the current BPropertyInfo instance into
a series of bytes which completely describes its state so it can be recreated from it later.  The
actual description of this byte representation of BPropertyInfo is described in the "implementation"
section below.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Unflatten:</B> The Unflatten() member function takes a passed in series of bytes and
sets the current BPropertyInfo instance into a copy of the BPropertyInfo described by those
bytes (ie a flattened version of a previous BPropertyInfo).  The old state of the current
BPropertyInfo is replaced by that described by the flattened representation.  The actual description
of this byte representation of BPropertyInfo is described in the "implemenation" section
below.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Print To Stream:</B> The PrintToStream() member function sends the current state of
the BPropertyInfo instance to standard out for debugging purpose.  The actual format of this output
isn't critical but it should describe the state of the object and be easy for a developer to
understand.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Find Match:</B> The FindMatch() member function takes a BMessage, a specifier (in the
form of a BMessage), a specifier type (called form, ie B_DIRECT_SPECIFIER), property name and an
index.  The member returns -1 if no match can be found.  A match will have the "what" code of the
message (not the specifier message) in its command list or have a wildcard command.  It will also
have the property name as its property name.  And, the specifier type will be listed as a valid
specifier, or the property will have a wildcard specifier.  Note, if the index is non-zero, then
only properties with command wildcards will be a match (a wildcard is an empty list of commands,
similarly for specifier type).  On a match, the result is a 0 based offset into the array of
properties.</P></LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="implement"></A><H2>BPropertyInfo Implementation:</H2>

<P>There is a key difference between the OpenBeOS BPropertyInfo class and the Be implementation
is support for BeOS R3 compiled executables.  The elements in the property_info structure changed
in R4 versus the one which was used in R3.  Be did the following to handle this:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The R3 constructor was made private.  Existing R3 binaries would use this constructor.  This
constructor would use static functions to convert between the old property_info structure passed
from the R3 binary to the new one.</LI>
<LI>A new constructor was introduced in R4.  This constructor would be source code compatible with
existing code which compiled on R3.  However, when that code was recompiled for R4, this new
constructor would be called because the old one was made private.</LI>
<LI>I expect that work was also done to ensure that the R4 BPropertyInfo class could unflatten
R3 based BPropertyInfo instances.  I have not done serious checking on this however.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For the OpenBeOS implementation, we have decided not to implement this R3 compatibility at
this time but we are not going to rule it out.  The header file for BPropertyInfo will be changed
to "remove" the R3 compatibility interfaces using an "ifdef R3_compatible".   The interfaces will
still appear to the human reader but not be there as far as the compiler is concerned.  If we
revise out decision in the future, it will be a simple matter of removing the ifdefs and implement
these R3 compatibility interfaces.  For now, we have decided not to do this because:</P>

<UL>
<LI>There is no binary compatibility between R3 and R4 of BeOS Intel.  The ability for OpenBeOS
to be binary compatible with these old R3 interfaces buys us nothing on Intel.</LI>
<LI>There is binary compatibility with R3 with R4 and R5 on BeOS PPC.  Without these interfaces
implemented, it may not be possible for R3 compiled binaries for PPC to operate against the
OpenBeOS implementation.  However, there are no specific plans to support PPC.  Also, the informal
PPC ports that have been discussed were considering using the gcc toolset which I believe precludes
any backward compatibility, even with R5 binaries.</LI>
<LI>There is some risk that a flattened BPropertyInfo instance on someone's hard disk was created
against the old R3 implementation.  The OpenBeOS implementation may not be able to read this
flattened BPropertyInfo.  However, we believe the chance of this happening to be very low and
not worth the cost of the implementation.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The flattened format of BPropertyInfo looks like the following:</P>

If fewer than 5 elements appear in any one set of the the three elements, four zero bytes are
in the stream where the "name" would be.  Also, to indicate that there are fewer than three

<P>The following is some information from Marc Flerackers sent in a series of emails which 
describes his investigation into how BPropertyInfo instances are flattened.  Note that the
implementation is very much based Marc's implementation elluded to in these messages, although
you will see some differences between the above description and Marc's messages.  The above
table describes the actual format as it is implemented today and seems to match Be's 
implementation.  However, Marc's investigation, implementation and emails were critical to
getting this information and is therefore included here in this document:</P>

<H3>Message 1:</H3>

<P>I spend this morning some time to check how a BPropertyInfo is flattened,
here's the result for BControl (not such a good choice as there are no
compound types, however I added at the bottom how the layout looks if there
are). I'm implementing this now in my own BPropertyInfo class. How is the
OBOS BPropertyInfo class going BTW?<P>

<H3>Message 2:</H3>

<P>Layout of a flattened BPropertyInfo with compound members. Value info is
still missing, I will look at it when I implement support for it in my
BPropertyInfo class. BTabView and BRadioButton are coming to cvs soon BTW, I
only have to find some time to write decent Draw functions ^_^.</P>

<H3>Message 3:</H3>

<P>Some updated information about the flattened BPropertyInfo layout for people
who are interested ^_^.</P>

<PRE>
The header contains flags, not a version

flattened header

4		count
4		flags

0x1 : property_info structs are present
0x2 : value_info structs are present

flattened value_info chunks are appended at the end as follows

a small header
4		count

for every value_info
2		kind
4		value
x		name
x		usage
4		extra_data

where x is strlen + 1 of course.
</PRE>

<P>Value info structs are used to publish information about non-Be types and
scripting commands btw.</P>

<P>I tested my code against the Be implementation, and the flattened data
matches.</P>
