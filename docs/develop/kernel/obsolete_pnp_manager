	PnP manager; Takes care of registration and loading of PnP drivers
	
	Read pnp_driver.h first to understand the basic idea behind PnP drivers.
	
	To register a driver node, use register_driver. If the device got lost, 
	use unregister_driver (note: if the parent node is removed, your node 
	get removed automatically as your driver has obviously nothing to work 
	with anymore). To get access to a (parent) device, use load_driver/
	unload_driver.
	
	To let the manager find a consumer (see pnp_driver.h), you can either
	specify its name directly during registration, using a 
	PNP_DRIVER_FIXED_CONSUMER attribute, or let the manager search the 
	appropriate consumer(s) via a PNP_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_CONSUMER attribute. 
	
	Searching of dynamic consumers is done as follows:
	
	- First, the manager searches for a Specific driver in the base 
	  directory (see below)
	- If no Specific driver is found, all Generic drivers stored under
	  "generic" sub-directory are informed in turn until one returns success
	- Finally, _all_ Universal drivers, stored in the "universal" sub-
	  directory, are informed

	Specification of the base directory and of the names of Specific 
	drivers is done via a file name pattern given by a 
	PNP_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_CONSUMER attribute. 
	
	First, all substrings of the form "%attribute_name%" are replaced by the 
	content of the attribute "attribute_name" as follows:
	
	- if the attribute contains an integer value, its content is converted to hex 
	  (lowercase) with a fixed length according to the attribute's value range
	- the content of string attributes is quoted by " and invalid characters 
	  (i.e. /%" and all characters outside 32..126) are replaced by their
	  unsigned decimal value, delimited by %
	- other attribute types cannot be used
	
	Second, the resulting name is split into chunks according to the presence 
	of | characters (you can escape % and | with a ^ character). These
	characters are only delimiters and get removed before further processing.
	The directory before the first | character is the base directory (see 
	above). It contains the "generic" and the "universal" subdirectories. 
	The names of the specific drivers are created by first taking the entire
	file name, then by removing the last chunk, then by removing the last
	two chunks and so on until only the first chunk is left. 

	As drivers can contain multiple modules, the module name is constructed
	by appending the content of the PNP_DRIVER_TYPE attribute to the driver's file
	name, seperated by a slash character (note: this only applies to dynamic
	consumers; for fixed consumers, you specify the module name directly via 
	PNP_DRIVER_FIXED_CONSUMER).
	
	E.g. given a dynamic consumer pattern of 
	"pci/vendor=%vendor_id%|, device=%device_id%" for a device with the 
	attributes vendor_id=0x123 and device_id=0xabcd (both being uint16), the
	PnP manager tries the specific drivers "pci/vendor=0123, device=abcd" and
	(if the first one fails/doesn't exist) "pci/vendor=0123". If they both
	refuse to handle the device, all drivers under "pci/generic" are tried
	until one accepts the device. Finally, all drivers under "pci/universal" 
	are	loaded, whatever happened before.

	In practise, you should try to use specific drivers as much as possible.
	If detection based on device IDs is impossible (e.g. because the bus 
	doesn't support them at all), you can put the driver under "generic".
	Generic drivers can also be used to specify wrappers that try to load old-
	style drivers if no new driver can be found. Also, they can be used to
	report an error or invoke an user program that tries downloading a
	proper Specific driver. Universal drivers are mainly used for 
	informational purposes, e.g. to publish data about each found device,
	or to provide raw access to all devices.
	
	If the device uses physical address space or I/O space or ISA DMA 
	channels (called I/O resources), the driver has to acquire these 
	resources. During hardware detection (usually via probe()), 
	acquire_io_resources() must be called to get exclusive access.
	If no hardware could be found, they must be released via 
	release_io_resources(). If detection was successful, the list of 
	the (acquired) resources must be passed to register_device().
	Resources can either belong to one hardware detection or to a device.
	If a hardware detection collides with another, it has to wait; 
	if it collides with a device whose driver is not loaded, the
	driver loading is blocked. When detection fails, i.e. if 
	release_io_resources() is called, all blocked drivers can be loaded
	again. If the detection fails, i.e. the resources are transferred
	via register_device(), all blocked devices are unregistered and
	pending load requests aborted. If a hardware detection collides
	with a device whose driver is loaded, acquire_io_resources() fails
	with B_BUSY. As this makes a hardware rescan impossible if the 
	driver is loaded, you should define	PNP_DRIVER_NO_LIVE_RESCAN 
	for nodes that use I/O resources (see below).
	
	To search for new drivers for a given device node, use rescan(). This
	marks all consumer devices as being verified and calls probe() 
	of all consumers drivers (see above) to let them rescan the parent 
	for devices. The <depth> parameter determines the nesting level, e.g.
	2 means that first the consumers are scanned and then the consumers
	of the consumers.
	
	Normally, all devices can be rescanned. If a driver cannot handle
	a rescan safely when it is loaded (i.e. used by a consumer), it
	must set PNP_DRIVER_NO_LIVE_RESCAN, in which case the device is
	ignored during rescan if the driver is loaded and attempts
	to load the driver during a rescan are blocked until the rescan
	is finished. If rescanning a device is not possible at all, it must
	have set PNP_DRIVER_NEVER_RESCAN to always ignore it.
	
	To distinguish between new devices, lost devices and redetected
	devices, consumer devices should provide a connection code and a
	device identifier. They are specified by PNP_DRIVER_CONNECTION and
	PNP_DRIVER_CONNECTION respectively, and are expanded in the same way
	as PNP_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_CONSUMER. It is assumed that there can be only
	one device per connection and that a device can be uniquely identify
	by a device identifier. If a consumer device is registered on the 
	same connection as an existing device but with a different device 
	identifier, the old device gets unregistered automatically. If both 
	connection and device identifier are the same, registration is 
	handled as a redetection and ignored (unless a different type or 
	driver module is specified - in this case, the device is replaced). 
	Devices that were not redetected during a rescan get unregistered
	unless they were ignored (see above).

	Required interface of PnP drivers

	In contrast to standard BeOS drivers, PnP drivers are normal modules
	having the interface described below.

	Every device is described by its driver via a PnP node with properties
	described in PnP Node Attributes. Devices are organized in a hierarchy, 
	e.g. a devfs device is a hard disk device that is connected to a 
	controller, which is a PCI device, that is connected to a PCI bus.
	Every device is connected to its lower-level device	via a parent link 
	stored in its Node. The higher-level is called the consumer of the 
	lower-level device. If the lower-level device gets removed, all its 
	consumers are removed too.

	In our example, the hierarchy is

	  devfs device -> hard disk -> controller -> PCI device -> PCI bus

	If the PCI bus is removed, everything up to including the devfs device
	is removed too.

	The driver hierarchy is constructed bottom-up, i.e. the lower-level
	driver searches for a corresponding consumer, which in turns searches
	for its consumer and so on. The lowest driver is usually something like
	a PCI bus, the highest driver is normally a devfs entry (see pnp_devfs.h).
	Registration of devices and the search for appropriate consumers is 
	done via the pnp_manager (see pnp_manager.h).

	When a potential consumer is found, it gets informed about the new
	lower-level device and can either refuse its handling or accept it.
	On accept, it has to create a new node with the	lower-level device 
	node as its parent.

	Loading of drivers is done on demand, i.e. if the consumer wants to
	access its lower-level device, it explicitely loads the corresponding 
	driver, and once it doesn't need it anymore, the lower-level driver
	must be unloaded. Usually, this process happens recursively, i.e. in
	our example, the hard disk driver loads the controller driver, which 
	loads the PCI device driver which loads the PCI bus driver. The same
	process applies to unloading.

	Because of this dynamic loading, drivers must store persistent data
	in the node of their devices. Please be aware that you cannot modify
	a node once published.

	If a device gets removed, you must unregister its node. As said, the
	PnP manager will automatically unregister all consumers too. The 
	corresponding drivers are notified to stop talking to their	lower-level 
	devices and to terminate running requests. Normally, you want to use a 
	dedicated variable that	is verified at each call to make sure that the 
	parent is still there. The notification is done independantly of the
	driver being loaded by its consumer(s) or not. If it isn't loaded,
	the notification callback gets NULL as the device cookie; normally, the
	driver returns immediately in this case. As soon as both the device
	is removed and the driver is unloaded, device_cleanup gets called to
	free resources that couldn't be safely removed in device_removed when
	the driver was still loaded.

	If a device has exactly one consumer, they often interact in some way.
	To simplify that, the consumer can pass a user-cookie to its parent
	during load. In this case, it's up to the parent driver to get a 
	pointer to the interface of the consumer. Effectively, such consumers
	have one interface for their consumers (base on pnp_driver_info), and 
	a another for their parents (with a completely driver-specific 
	structure).

	In terms of synchronization, loading/unloading/remove-notifications
	are executed synchronously, i.e. if e.g. a device is to be unloaded 
	but	the drive currently handles a remove-notification, the unloading 
	is delayed until the nofication callback returns. If multiple consumers
	load a driver, the driver gets initialized only once; subsequent load
	requests increase an internal load count only and return immediately.
	In turn, unloading only happens once the load count reaches zero.

	Required interface of PnP bus drivers

	Busses consist of two node layers: the lower layer defines the bus,
	the upper layer defines the abstract devices connected to the bus. 
	Both layers are handled by a bus manager. Actual device nodes are 
	on top of abstract device nodes.

	E.g. if we have a PCI bus with an IDE controller on it, we get

	IDE controller -> PCI device -> PCI bus

	with:
		IDE controller = actual device node
		PCI device = abstract device node
		PCI bus = bus node

	The PCI bus manager establishes both the PCI devices and the PCI busses.

	Abstract device nodes act as a gateway between actual device nodes
	and the corresponding bus node. They are constructed by the bus 
	node driver via	its rescan() hook. To identify a bus node, define
	PNP_BUS_IS_BUS as an attribute of it. As a result, the PnP manager
	will call the rescan() method of the bus driver whenever the
	bus is to be rescanned. Afterwards, all possible dynamic consumers
	are informed as done for normal nodes.

	Normally, potential device drivers are notified immediately when 
	rescan() registers a new abstract device node. But sometimes, device
	drivers need to know _all_ devices connected to the bus for correct
	detection. To ensure this, the bus node must define 
	PNP_BUS_NOTIFY_CONSUMERS_AFTER_RESCAN. In this case, scanning for
	consumers is postponed until rescan() has finished.

	If hot-plugging of devices can be detected automatically (e.g. USB), 
	you should define PNP_DRIVER_ALWAYS_LOADED, so the bus driver is 
	always loaded and thus capable of handling hot-plug events generated 
	by the bus controller hardware.
