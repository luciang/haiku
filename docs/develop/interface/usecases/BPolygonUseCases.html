<H1>BPolygon Use Cases and Implementation Details:</H1>

<P>This document describes the BPolygon interface and some basics of how it is implemented.
The document has the following sections:</P>

<A NAME="interface"></A><H2>BPolygon Interface:</H2>

<P>The BPolygon class is used to hold information about a shape composed of a series of straight
lines (ie a polygon).  On its own, it just describes the shape and can only be drawn by passing
it to a BView.  The best source of source of information for the BPolygon interface can be found
<A HREF="file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/The%20Interface%20Kit/Polygon.html">here in the Be Book</A>.
</P>

<A NAME="usecases"></A><H2>BPolygon Use Cases:</H2>

<P>The following use cases cover the BPolygon functionality:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P><B>Construction 1:</B> A BPolygon can be constructed without passing it any arguments.  When
this is done, the polygon will have no points in it (ie no shape) until they are added through
AddPoints().</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Construction 2:</B> A BPolygon can be constructed by passing it a pointer to an existing
BPolygon (ie a copy constructor).  The resulting copy will have the exact same state as the 
one passed in.  That means it will have the same number of points in the same locations resulting
in the same shape.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Construction 3:</B> A BPolygon can be constructed by passing it a pointer to an array of
BPoints and an integer which describes the number of points in that array.  The BPolygon will be
constructed such that it holds the shape described by that array of points.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Destruction:</B> When a BPolygon is deconstructed any memory allocated in order to hold
the state of the BPolygon is freed and the state of the polygon is lost.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Add Points:</B> The AddPoints() member function appends a number of passed in points to
the existing set of points already in the polygon.  It takes a pointer to an array of BPoints and
an integer count of the number of points to append.  This is similar to the "Construction 3" use 
case except in that case there is no existing points so the passed in points describe the entire
polygon.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Count Points:</B> The CountPoints() member function returns the number of points which
describe the polygon.  The result is an integer.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Frame:</B> The Frame() member function returns the smallest BRect which contains all of
the points which describes the BPolygon.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Map To:</B> The MapTo() member function applies a translation (ie move) and a scale (ie
grow/shrink) operation to the existing polygon, adjusting all points according to the passed in
rule.  The operation to apply depends on two passed in BRect's.  The translation and scale 
adjustment which turns the first BRect into the second BRect is applied to all points in the
BPolygon.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Print To Stream:</B> The PrintToStream() member function sends the set of points which
make up the BPolygon to standard output.  It does so by performing a PrintToStream() on the
individual BPoint's which make up the polygon.  This member is generally used for debugging and
the output is primarily human readable and not sensitive to changes which could risk backward
compatibility.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Assignment Operator</B> The operator=() operator is defined for BPolygon's.  It takes
a source BPolygon and assigns it to another existing BPolygon target.  The state of the target
BPolygon is lost and replaced with that of the source.  The source retains its state so the outcome
is two BPolygons with the same state (ie set of points).</P></LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="implement"></A><H2>BPolygon Implementation:</H2>

<P>Internally, the BPolygon contains an array of BPoint's which it uses to track the shape it
holds.  The implementation of BPolygon is fairly simple since it is a fairly basic container
class for a set of points.</P>
