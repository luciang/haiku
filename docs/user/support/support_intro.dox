/** \page support The Support Kit

The Support Kit provides a handy set of functions and classes that you can
use in your applications. It is part of both, libbe.so and libroot.so - a
clear distinction of where you'll find what is still to be written/created.
Documentation is avaible for the following parts:

	- \ref parsedate.h Date parsing functions 
	- \ref syslog.h system logging capabilities
