To customize the settings defined in these headers, create a folder "user_config_headers" in the "build" folder and copy the headers you want to modify into that folder. Your custom headers will be ignored by SVN and the build system will automatically use them instead of the original ones. But be aware that when changes are commited to the files in "config_headers", you will have to apply them to your custom headers manually.
